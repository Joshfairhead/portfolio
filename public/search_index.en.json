This comes from our teams desire to bridge the gap between research and implementation.\nThe proposal below outlines the current state of our implementation plan and we are soliciting discussion and feedback for further advancement. There is plenty of scope for improvement, which we trust will happen as we advance our work. We believe that the proposal submitted to PL can help lay strong research foundations; while Regen is fertile soil for technical implementation that contributes to grounded impact in real communities.\nSpecifications\nRegen Registry defines Nature Based Solutions in the following manner:\n\n“Adaptive Capital” is subsequently a proposition for valuing living ecosystems through multi-perspective architecture and the free energy principal; a means of evaluating quantitive measures with qualitative outcomes. For such a project to find traction, we need to consider the existential domains of markets, science and technology; while holding in mind the essential values of people, planet and protocols. Let’s explore our assumptions about these domains:\nMarket Assumptions Markets are seeking pathways for divestment from degenerate commodities to more regenerative investment vehicles. However the divestment is constrained by a lack of said pathways and it’s estimated that there are two trillion dollars of stranded assets trading on Wall St. books. In the authors opinion this number represents a transformation opportunity thats global in scale provided we can address the markets pain points with integrity. Please see the RFP-X Research doc for a more detailed contextual framing on this subject.\nScientific Assumptions When it comes to addressing the markets with integrity, we need to incorporate truth claims and anchor this context. The methods used and the claims made are important; Popper believed science was about the raw explanatory power and predictive capacity of a framework, while Khun thought of it as a community of practice.\nIn our view both authors are correct; reason can thought of as rational proof (deductive knowledge utilising the Baconian methodology) and as empiric verification (inductive wisdom through the Goethian methodology). Consequentially the ReSci movement might consider integrating both these fundamental approaches to making truth claims by leveraging abductive reasoning and Bayesian methods. These base predictions on known priors before feeding forward to infer likely outcomes.\nTechnological Assumptions From a practical standpoint the story of digital communication begins with Claude Shannons information theory; binary 1’s and 0’s that convey state. Beyond Shannon’s fundamental theory of bits and bytes, there are new innovations that abstract his binary domain into a trinary lens of “agents, languages and perspectives” where agents, speaking their language of preference, express perspectives on ‘Truth claims’.\nAs a technical architecture, such a ‘meta ontology’ enables us to encode other frameworks as ‘perspectives’, and in particular we believe that encoding “general systematics” is a particularly powerful epistemological framework that can act as a functional backbone for articulating parameter groupings in a transparent way.\nApplied at the interface level these functional frameworks can be used to generate a consistent set of active inference models that enable the composable encoding of practice based methodologies, eco-credits, accounting methodologies, evaluation criteria, sensor networks APIs, DAOs and far beyond. Such architecture is particularly elegant as it enables semantic translation and ad hoc composibility for an apples to oranges comparison of quantitive measures to qualitative values.\nInfrastructure Design\nLet’s frame the high level design abstractions we will lean on in relation to our ends: These could more sensibly be framed as:\n\nMarkov blankets act as a form of general substrate that can then be further systematised with metadata to enable semantic interoperability - this is a highly general medium that is analogus to merkle trees and hash graphs. In Regens case this technical infrastructure is represented by the data module.\nAn Impact certificate essentially articulates a given methodology in a machine readable format. These certificates represent a set of means, while evaluation criteria codified in a similar format can express values as ends. For example - when it comes to open science - there is a growing movement towards making papers more accessible by encoding them as ‘conversation graphs’; this might be represented in a tetradic geometry with nodes representing:\n\nExtrapolating such a concept one step further it’s easy enough to imagine a form of bespoke facilitation where the content of any conversation can be functionally represented as geometries to support the processes of communal understanding.\nWhen a discussion reaches consensus on credit class, methodology, DAO design, evaluation criteria etc. we can use the interface to easily store and anchor data on chain. Any subsequent dialogue can be self-managed by the community, easily updating their credit design parameters through their governance process through a simple interface. Supporting conversation and data can be aggregated as a form of composable capital to be issued as eco-credits which would democratise access to technology in a significant way. Such a process can even be turned into art or gamified to make the process fun and rewarding!\nBelow the interface level comes the functional specifications for on chain integration. Using the AD4M ontology we can integrate general systematics to describe a set of metadata standards. From there we can describe both the data module and eco-credit modules as ‘languages’ and ‘perspectives’ in order to make them interoperable with other systems architectures. For added precision, we may wish to add other ontological ‘perspectives’ for translating quantity (data module claims like MRV) to quality (eco-credit attestations like REA).\nIn the case of the latter Resource, Event, Agent accounting is a particularly useful ontology to integrate as its institutionally recognised accounting standard for distributed supply chains. This might then use feeds from Monitoring, Reporting and Verification technologies as evaluation criteria for impact certificates. The elegance of this design is that if these standards are changed or extended, they can be easily recomposed or updated.\nFor example we can extend the triadic geometry MRV to be a tetradic geometry for a more detailed resolution. The following was articulated by dMeter community members:\n\nUltimately whatever indicators are at desirable can be articulated through General Systematics and codified as Markov blankets to unlock the capabilities of semantically composable impact markets. These functional models can then be enriched with Active Inferencing to provide a more detailed depth of resolution.\nPilot Tokenomic Mechanism(s): Adaptive Capital\nThe architecture above is designed at the level of general infrastructure and can be used for composing any desirable credit design, which is dependent on the articulation of parametric groupings instantiated around a use case or pilot project. These paramaters and the rules governing them matter significantly when scaled to the level community, commons or bioregion.\nThere are already number of great projects in the Regen ecosystem that would stand to benefit from such composable designs and we’re keen to partner based on DAO capacity. LunarPunk Labs as proposal authors have a strong preference towards working closely with our existing partners at the charity Regenerating Sonora in order to build out a low risk pilot project. Conditions around them are exceptionally vital as they have LEHR gardens, a community centre with a blockchain learning desk and high school tech club working with Arudino sensors!\nBasic Credits: Regenerating Sonora use case\n\nCommunity Capital: H3 University use case\nAn example methodology our students might use to additionally codify the co-benefits produced by the communities vibrant social capital is the H3uni framework deployed on the current course “The art of creative collaboration”. This particular practice based methodology groups eight sets of parameters under four framing conditions.\nFraming conditions:\n\nParamater Groupings:\n\nThis particular methodology is currently being demonstrated as both the H3uni course with video documentary evidence AND is being discussed amongst our teams on WeCo.io as a ‘weave’ (chains of 1min audio recordings / 140 character cards in a sequence as a conversation graph). The data from this form of ‘prosocial-computation’ can all be anchored on a storage medium of choice using the Regen Data Module.

He’s also a semi-pro skater and screen printer!\nThe flavour of C2C is pretty characteristic of Richards distinct style but as a team of turntabilists, the group won the World DMC Championship enough times to get banned from competing. The tracks have a flavour of funky electronic disco and seems to satisfy most peoples tastes in any group gathering. It also consistently breaks the mould enough for those who desire texture, novelty and refinement in their music.\nRichards other stuff is solid too; most if not all of his productions feel sonically well polished and are often delivered with a simple but well designed and creative video like “Kodema” or “The Beat”. If you want a groove you’ll find that C2C and 20syl has enough rythmic elements churned with modern synthesis to warm up most crowds; for example “Can You Dance To This”?\nSome other hot picks not to miss out on are “Down The Road”, “Back &amp; Forth” and “Le Banquet”. If you dig lyrics however, Sylvains project with J.D. Mederios (Alltta) is also very much worth checking out; particularly the track “Disarm” which moves me every listen.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/avishicohen/","title":"Avishi Cohen","description":null,"body":"Album: Continuo\nDouble bass, drums and piano is all you need as an Israeli jazz trio. The drum and bass rhythm section gel particularly together but the keys are still a very nice touch that couldn’t be done without.\nThe album Continuo is a graceful journey through what feels like a desert, through many a figurative “emotional storm”. It has a breadth, depth and a vastness that I’ve not heard on many other albums and it feels extremely authentic and honest in its underlying nature.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/brianwilson/","title":"Brian Wilson","description":null,"body":"Albums: Pet Sounds, SMiLE\nYou know the Beach Boys right? Well Brian Wilson was arguably the driving talent behind most of their sucess; he wrote most of the songs, the arrangements, hired the musicians and ran the studio production. Obviously “Pet Sounds” was the album that reached fame and critical acclaim due to the pioneering studio productions on the hit “Good Vibrations”.\nWhat many people don’t know however is that there was a follow up album that made use of the same pioneering techniques as “Good Vibrations” that was was LOST for 40 years. This was Brians masterpiece, which finally saw the light of day in 2004. Naturally, there’s an incredible story behind the albums history, with several documentaries like “Beautiful Dreamer” available that one should really take the time to watch for themselves. As such, I’ll leave that aspect alone.\nAnyway, thanks to members of “The Wondermints” helping Bryan get back on track - particularly Darian Shanana - the 2004 version SMiLE is frankly the most spiritual album your likely to find for miles; the ProTools recording is an audiophiles wet dream with luscious vocal harmonies, wall of sound instrumental arrangements (inclusive of barritone harmonicas) and a brilliant sense of psychedelic humour!\nAs a concept album, there are several elemental themes woven into the albums fabric. For me the water sections transition between “Child is Father of the Man” and “Surfs Up” has a shimmering depth, thanks to the Stockholm Strings and their emotive glissando’s. Theres plenty of substance to the album, just get in for a swim!\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/theband/","title":"The Band","description":null,"body":"The Band\nAlbums: The Brown Album, Music From Big Pink, Northern Lights - Southern Cross, The Last Waltz.\nThese guys really were a potent brew of gifted musicians, starting out with Ronnie Hawk before joining Bob Dylan when he went electric. They basically knew everyone that was anyone in the 60’s and 70’s as exemplified in “The Last Waltz” (Maritn Scorsese) which has them sharing the stage with the former names as well as Neil Young, Joni Mitchel, Van Morrison, Neil Diamond, Muddy Waters, Eric Clapton, Dr. John, Ronnie Wood, Ringo Star, Paul Butterfield and Emmylou Harris.\nNeil Youngs cocaine moustache on his performance of “Helpless” was apparently one of the most expensive video edits of the time. “I got it now Robbie”, he says after an off pitch tune up before he quickly manages to turn things around. Joni Mitchell helps as a backing singer. This tune with Joni Michell on backing is certainly one of the gigs highlights along with “Caravan”, “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down”, “The Weight” and many of the bands other original songs like “Arcadian Driftwood”.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/killitkid/","title":"Kill it Kid","description":null,"body":"Albums: Kill it Kid, Feet Fall Heavy, You Owe Nothing.\nKill it Kid were a pretty short lived band from Bristol with an evolution that went from bluesy folk to blisteringly hard rock over the course of three albums. Theres a clear tension of unrequited love between the vocalists that seems to build to a breaking point by the third album (they later hooked up and continued as the outfit Ida Mae).\nBoth singers are skilled instrumentalists; Chris Turnpin must have sold his soul to the devil to play guitar in such an authentic manner, while the keyboards have a practiced jazz influence to them (no doubt from a rock school). The rhythm section are arguably there to support the two main stars but they do a professional job, keeping things tight and stylistically appropriate.\nEach album feels pretty complete in it’s own right so it’s perhaps best to think of each as phases of tension, coherent in themselves and in sequence; it was consequentially quite exciting to track the bands career trajectory as it happened in real time - from folk violins to blisteringly heavy rock.\nIf you want to know where to start “Feet Fall Heavy” exhibits the bands best writing across albums, while “Burned in the By &amp; By” was a great Abby Road extra produced at the bands zenith yet sadly never appeared on any album. This is the dial set somewhere in the middle.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/robertfripp/","title":"Robert Fripp","description":null,"body":"Albums: In the Court of the Crimson King, Lizard, Red, The Power to Believe\nRobert Fripp of King Crimson is arguably one of the most diciplined musicians out there, practicing six hours a day in order to perform near impossible arrangements like “FracKture” with a triple band lineup consisting of some of the best musicians on the plannet. It’s a pretty impressive lineup!\nThe band made their debut in 1969 with the album “In the Court of The Crimson King” which is their most famous by a long shot - you know, the one with the iconic screaming face. Apparently their first performance of “21st Century Schitzoid Man” in Hyde Park left the audience so disoriented that people forgot to clap the Rolling Stones onto stage!\nFor many years I found “Red” the most appealing album as it feels particularly whole and exhibits some incredible compositions. The album was titled “Red” because the band broke so many formal musical rules that if you submitted it for a music school exam you’d have received the report back full of red crosses. As suggested by such a story, the album breaks boundaries and sounds incredible having been recorded at Air Lyndhurst in London - the studio George Martin (the fifth Beatle) bought and refitted. The tracks “One More Red Nightmare” and “Starless” are in my opinion highlights of the album.\nAnother enthralling album is “The Power to Believe”, which displays quite some virility. It’s a modern album with electronic instruments, bone crushing guitars and some luscious moments of release. The rhythms, textures, compositions and technicality are vital elements of the resultant soundscape. You probably won’t find anything like it anywhere else; incredibly creative and powerful stuff that’s akin to a non-traditional gamelan.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/floatingpoint/","title":"Floating Points","description":null,"body":"\n\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/stevewilson/","title":"Steve Wilson","description":null,"body":"Albums: Fear of a Blank Planet, In Absentina, Deadwing, Closure/Continuation, The Harmony Codex\nThis list has a number of prolific creators on it as you may have already noticed, and Steve Wilson is no different. Besides his main band Porcupine Tree and his solo career, he is also King Crimsons mix and mastering engineer (amongst many other bands, particularly in Prog).\nPorcupine tree has relatively large discography, though generally speaking I’ve found the cream begins to rise from “Fear of a Blank Planet” onwards. This is roughly the period when Gavin Harrison joined the band, who you might recognise as 1/3 of Crimsons Rhythm section; naturally he is one a hell of a drummer.\nGuitars, synths, bass and vocals are all arranged tastefully across Wilsons work too. Things tend to get more jazzy as Porcupine Tree ages, though that’s not to say that C/C is soft by any means. This is evidenced by the extremely gritty telecasters on tracks like “Rats Return” which is a bone crusher of a riff… Not to mention “Herd Culling”.\nTrying out Wilsons solo stuff you’ll find that it’s more eclectic; the Harmony Codex being more electronic in nature though it’s still characteristic of his unique style with complex vocal harmonies and textured layers. The videos are also quite creative, especially the one for his AI generated Christmas song “December Skies” or “Economies of Scale”.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/sturgilsimpson/","title":"Sturgill Simpson","description":null,"body":"Albums: Sailors Guide to Earth, Sound and Fury\nSomething more less jazz you say? Ok, well, Sturgil keeps things safe by keeping to familiar progressions and standard time signatures, though he does a fantastic job of making them interesting. He even recognises and discloses the recursivity of his writing in the lyrics of “All Said and Done”!\n\nKeep staring at the pages, coming up with the same lines,It’s all been said and done by now, two or three times.\n\nThis however is not surprising (as he knows how to wield the pen) because the line is also symbolic of the essence of his breakthrough album which was title called “Meta-modern Sounds in Country Music”. Yep, psychedelic country music. You can’t find a larger market than country music so he pretty much nailed the business strategy for going mainstream! (intentional or otherwise)\nHinted at by the album title “A Sailors Guide to Earth” and reading between the lines of “Welcome to Earth Pollywog” and “Keep Between The Lines” it seems pretty obvious that the albums intended as a time capsule for his newborn child. In particular I’d recommend the track “Brace For Impact” for its lyrics framed by a particularly solid bass line chugging the title into life (what a shaker in the chorus!). The motown vibe throughout this album also has an authenticity to it akin to the Muscle Shoals sound.\nIf your a fan of the Danger Mouse sound (Black Keys), then you’ll appreciate the production of Sound and Fury, which exemplifies the style - for instance painting in the drums of “Best Clock Maker on Mars” which has a precise and unrelenting shuffle. The aesthetic of switching radio stations is pretty creative too and reminds me of Pink Floyds “Wish You Were Here”. Once the blistering guitars get too intense (they do), your treated to some melting moments of release like in the tune “Make Art, Not Friends”; as such I’d suggest sticking with the tension and listening to the album straight through from start to finish… oh and “Remember to Breathe”! ;)\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/snarkypuppy/","title":"Snarky Puppy","description":null,"body":"Albums: We Like it Here, Family Dinner\nA well composed cosmopolitian fusion of jazz, funk, rock, blues, hip hop, electro and soul. Sounds a bit much right? Well, it’s less about the ingredients than what’s getting cooked with them. Here we have a big band that knows how to tastefully bend and blend genres.\nDepending on the album your listening to the flavour varies. If your into the instrumental hip hop vibes then “We Like It Here” is a great album - plenty of exotic sun and colourful places to explore. The dirty bass line towards the end of “Shofukan” is worth the wait, with complex textures and rolling soundscapes are on the way towards this distination!\nIf your looking for something more traditional big band, with vocals and such, then start with the album “Family Dinner” instead. If you ask me the tracks “Gone Under” and “Fire to Hot to Last” are the jewls of that gathering; funky, sexy and bad to the bone.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/fatfreddiesdrop/","title":"Fat Freddies Drop","description":null,"body":"Albums: BOATS, Blackbird.\nFunky, dubby, souly, psychedelic goodness from Wellington New Zealand. For those literate enough to read the songlines, there are landscapes packed into BOATS thats brimming with meaning and significance assuming you can feel the soul. The bands first album “Based on a True Story” (aka BOATS) with its acrostically evocative album cover is probably the bands most popular work, although Blackbird has a sense of ratna earthyness that shouldn’t be ignored.\nThe production of both albums are top notch; high quality recordings, strong arrangements, soulful vocals, nuanced and expressive lyrics - vibes all round.\nIf you ask me, pretty much all all the tracks on BOATS are strong, though if you’d like something to illustrate my earlier claims then “Ray Ray” is a good track to try on for size with it’s muted bass lines, sharply polished lazer beam SFX and smooth vocals. For those that enjoy contrast, the pimped out producion of Ray Ray eases off the gas by moving into “Dark Days” which tastes more organic, dynamic and emotive. Let the acoustic, horns, crash and brushed snare sweep you into the ebb and flow of a three four waltz; for me this song really embodies the heart of the psychedelic experience and what it means to be human.\nBlackbird is a different vibe; still distinctly the Drop but the music has a different feel thats murkier and perhaps more magic mushrooms than LSD. The tracks have a looser and more lumpy quality than the ones found on BOATS. The standout track for me on this album is “Mother Mother” due to its exceptionally smooth transition from acoustic band into a more synthy electro pulse before fade out.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/ghost/","title":"Ghost","description":null,"body":"Albums: Impera, Meliora\nHaving seen the Tobias Forge - Ghosts songwriter - on the covers of numerous music mags over the years I initially dismissed them based on the pantomine image. However, having had many of the music distribution channels force the album Imperala down my throat, I’ve come to realise the genius of this spectacle!\nLyrics sang by front man “Papa Emeratis” - the dark pope - are often a timeless tongue in cheek commentary of empires and the circularity of society and politics. The content is poetic, exceptionally perceptive and often humourous. There are degrees of politcis, while also speaking to the darkness of the marginalised as embodied in the music video “cirice”.\nAll in all their discography is pretty good and singles like “Call me Little Sunshine” are excellent. Theres some serious songwriting chops and a deep craft here; in particular “Spillways” is a stand out composition that comes to mind. There are some more subtle easter eggs of Sabbath, Van Halen and Ozzy riffs if you listen carefully to the arrangements as well - particularly on “Watcher in the Sky”. If the these classic rockers had a love child with Abba you’d probably get Ghost, ’cos damn the materials catchy!\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/robertplant/","title":"Robert Plant","description":null,"body":"Album: Mighty Rearranger, Dreamland\nWhile a lot of Robert Plants solo work doesn’t really float my boat, Mighty Rearranger is absolutely fantastic! “Another Tribe” starts the album with a rhythmic vitality that beams sunshine everywhere, which is appropriate given the second track is called “Shine It All Around”. This track is another winner on the production given it’s many layred vocals and huge echo effects on the chorus - hard to believe it was recoded in a small Welsh studio. At the end of the album there’s also a drum and bass remix of this tune which is pretty nice. Roberts not lost his voice or soul even at this stage of his career.\nHonourable mentions as well to the album Dreamland which is also pretty strong; particularly “Darkness, Darkness” and his cover of Dylan’s “One More Cup Of Coffee”. Of course we could add a lot of the Zeppelin stuff here as well but I’m deliberately avoiding review of obvious classics as those trails are known.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/hilltophoods/","title":"Hilltop Hoods","description":null,"body":"Albums: Hard Road Restrung, State of The Art, Walking Under Stars, Drinking from the Sun, Into the Abyss\nAs the name might suggest, Hilltop are indeed one of Australias biggest hip hop acts - though I’m pretty sure their name came before the fame. Whatever the case it’s well deserved as lyric wise the two MCs are beyond first class wordsmiths. Earlier albums are seemingly less personal and more raw, while later albums are considerably more personal with a pop edge. This is a small price to pay for the added depth and dimensionality and quite frankly the production grows on you.\nWalking Under Stars is probably the darkest period of the bands tenure, with “Live and Let Go” as one of the more profound pieces of lyrical prowess, where guest MC Brother Ali and Pressure drop some lines that are beyond poetic. I’ll not labour how good this group is though, as I’ve a more refined post to drop related to the Hilltop Story.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/wolfmother/","title":"Wolfmother","description":null,"body":"Album: Cosmic Egg\nOxymoronically, “Cosmic Egg” is what might be called contemporary classic rock; if you like layers of multi-tracked guitars, this albums full of psychedelic phasers, wah peddles and possibly double necked Gibson SGs. In other words its guitar hero stuff all the way through and there’s a generous sixteen tracks on offer that hold consistent in their quality.\nThey have been criticised for reinventing the wheel, which I personally felt when I first heard them, but honestly that’s pretty much the issue with classic rock - it’s set in stone. After listening through a couple of times the album really grew on me and I’ll happily say that Wolfmother are innovating in a field with little room left to maneuver - Cosmic Egg being the jewel in their discography.\nPersonally speaking, I’m favorable to the ralentandos (tempo shifts) and arpeggios on “Eyes Open” and “Violence of the Sun”. They are just all too satisfying.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/nilerodgers/","title":"Nile Rodgers","description":null,"body":"Albums: Risque, Random Access Memories,\nNile has always churned out hits since the early days of Chic’s “Everybody Dance”, through to Daft Punks “[Get Lucky(https://youtu.be/5NV6Rdv1a3I?si=vIVs58KmrMu0NhWv)]”. What’s most amazing about him is his ability to take complex jazz voicings and create a polished pop masterpiece without a hint of dissonance. Check out his interviews, he’s a wonderful story teller and is living proof that Disco doesn’t suck (though he was somewhat forced into new territories by the movement).\nMyself, I’m a fan of the Chic classics like “Everybody Dance” and “Good times” for the uplifting funk vibes and genere defining style of guitar and bass leading the rhythm section; Bernard Edwards being Niles legendary compatriot on the low end. Absolutely Rocking.\nBesides Chic’s tunes, Nile is pretty much all over the map when it comes to major artists; Madonna, Sister Sledge, Bowie, Duran Duran and so on - though Daft Punk’s last album is for me the most interesting. Of course “Get Lucky” with Pharell Williams was the big splash but “Give Life Back to Music” and “Loose Yourself to Dance” are arguably better pieces of craft.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/maynardjameskenan/","title":"Maynard James Keenan","description":null,"body":"Bands: Tool, Pusifer, Perfect Circle.\nAlbums: Fear Innoculum, 10,000 Days, Conditions of My Parole, Existential Reckoning, Eat the Elephant,\nMaynard is yet another unrelenting creative, god knows where he gets the energy from but every breath drawn appears to be used towards the creation of something new. From any one of his three bands to his businesses and vineyards. The quality of his output is also extremely high, all the albums listed above sound great and come with all the bells and whistles of premium merch and so forth. A born performer!\nTools last two records are particularly note worthy due to the detailed arrangements and production values. Fear Innoculum in particular has a smooth coalescence that is eloquently whole and complete. If you trace back the bands history it will become quite apparent that this is the finished product; 10,000 days is really strong, though rougher around the edges - as with the albums prior to that. The advantage to these earlier albums however are the esoteric Easter eggs that correlate to fibonnachi ratios, or tracks that can be layered over each other.\nMusically the band is a full package; rhythmically, harmonically, melodically interesting with highly refined messaging. Many of the tracks sound extremely organic due to the odd time signatures like 7/8 or 5/4. This tends to move about as well. Favorite Tool tracks include “Jambi”, “The Pot” and “Vicarious” from 10,000 Days and perhaps “Invincible” or “Decending” from Fear Innoculum though it’s a harder album to pick from due to the self similar cohesiveness of the tracks.\nPuscifer then are another vibe, much less esoteric and more of a comedy show or drama than anything. It’s quite something. You get all sorts of characters and narratives popping out of this setup; seemingly a parody on life, or maybe the three gunas who then give rise to the wheel of samsara. Musically Pusifer are more versitile and experimental than Tool or APC, which has a charming novelty, though at the cost of consistency which is quite honestly advertised as SPAM. Tracks to dig on would be the title track of “Conditions of My Parole”, which is a really solid album with tracks like “Monsoons” “The Weaver”, “Green Valley” and then other tunes like “Bread and Circus” and “Bullet Train to Iowa” from the album Existential Reckoning (#IamTheBriefcase).\nA Perfect Circle are then much closer to Tool than Pusifer. There are a few albums to choose from and they’re all worth a listen, though I’d recommend “Eat the Elephant” as the most mature. In particular the title track stands out as delicate and spacious, while “Disillusioned” has the production, arrangement, lyrics and performance.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/steelydan/","title":"Steely Dan","description":null,"body":"Albums: Can’t Buy a Thrill, Pretzel Logic, The Royal Scam, Aja,\nNamed after a large silver dildo, Steely Dan are as you might guess rather provocative and unapologetic. Despite what some might consider to be a vulgar or crass band name, the musics about as as smooth as it gets and also pretty refined. These virtues come courtesy of the well thought out arrangements, the best jazz musicians of the time in some of the best studios. Apparently a descriptive term applied to them by a journalist at one point or another was “Yacht Rock”, which is quite apt!\nIn funny sort of way, Steely Dan are actually kind of like a cynical version of Byran Wilson. The genius is certainly there with their cream of the crop arrangements, artsy lyrics, unusual instruments and so forth - so the real difference is the tone and taste… Dan as you might suspect are less innocent and a dollop more dark.\nAlbum wise the Royal Scam is probably my favourite of the lot, though Aja is one of the most famous. Cherry picking a few songs the likes of “Dirty Work”, “Fire in the Hole”, “Any Major Dude”, “Kid Charlemagne”, and “The Royal Scam” come to mind.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/all/","title":"Special Mentions","description":null,"body":"Albums:\nJohn Butler Trio: Grand National\nXavier Rudd: Solace\nMorcheeba: Big Calm\nNightmares on Wax: Smokers Delight\nRodger Chapman: Chappo\nElton John: Tumbleweed Collection\nTracks:\nKate Tempest: Peoples faces\nLovework: Black light smoke\nGlen Gould: Art of Fugue\nPolyphia: G.O.A.T\nSufjan Stevens: Chicago\nSuper Tramp: Crime of the Centuary\nHaruomi Honso: Shin Shin Shin\nGramatik: Hold On\nGUTS: Peacefull life, Rest of My Life\nBooker T.

Everything on this album has a similarly distinct texture which will appeal to folks with a wide musical palette.
