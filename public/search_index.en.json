The drum and bass rhythm section gel particularly together but the keys are still a very nice touch that couldn’t be done without.\nThe album Continuo is a graceful journey through what feels like a desert, through many a figurative “emotional storm”. It has a breadth, depth and a vastness that I’ve not heard on many other albums and it feels extremely authentic and honest in its underlying nature.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/brianwilson/","title":"Brian Wilson","description":null,"body":"Albums: Pet Sounds, SMiLE\nYou know the Beach Boys right? Well Brian Wilson was arguably the driving talent behind most of their sucess; he wrote most of the songs, the arrangements, hired the musicians and ran the studio production. Obviously “Pet Sounds” was the album that reached fame and critical acclaim due to the pioneering studio productions on the hit “Good Vibrations”.\nWhat many people don’t know however is that there was a follow up album that made use of the same pioneering techniques as “Good Vibrations” that was was LOST for 40 years. This was Brians masterpiece, which finally saw the light of day in 2004. Naturally, there’s an incredible story behind the albums history, with several documentaries like “Beautiful Dreamer” available that one should really take the time to watch for themselves. As such, I’ll leave that aspect alone.\nAnyway, thanks to members of “The Wondermints” helping Bryan get back on track - particularly Darian Shanana - the 2004 version SMiLE is frankly the most spiritual album your likely to find for miles; the ProTools recording is an audiophiles wet dream with luscious vocal harmonies, wall of sound instrumental arrangements (inclusive of barritone harmonicas) and a brilliant sense of psychedelic humour!\nAs a concept album, there are several elemental themes woven into the albums fabric. For me the water sections transition between “Child is Father of the Man” and “Surfs Up” has a shimmering depth, thanks to the Stockholm Strings and their emotive glissando’s. Theres plenty of substance to the album, just get in for a swim!\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/fatfreddiesdrop/","title":"Fat Freddies Drop","description":null,"body":"Albums: BOATS, Blackbird.\nFunky, dubby, souly, psychedelic goodness from Wellington New Zealand. For those literate enough to read the songlines, there are landscapes packed into BOATS thats brimming with meaning and significance assuming you can feel the soul. The bands first album “Based on a True Story” (aka BOATS) with its acrostically evocative album cover is probably the bands most popular work, although Blackbird has a sense of ratna earthyness that shouldn’t be ignored.\nThe production of both albums are top notch; high quality recordings, strong arrangements, soulful vocals, nuanced and expressive lyrics - vibes all round.\nIf you ask me, pretty much all all the tracks on BOATS are strong, though if you’d like something to illustrate my earlier claims then “Ray Ray” is a good track to try on for size with it’s muted bass lines, sharply polished lazer beam SFX and smooth vocals. For those that enjoy contrast, the pimped out producion of Ray Ray eases off the gas by moving into “Dark Days” which tastes more organic, dynamic and emotive. Let the acoustic, horns, crash and brushed snare sweep you into the ebb and flow of a three four waltz; for me this song really embodies the heart of the psychedelic experience and what it means to be human.\nBlackbird is a different vibe; still distinctly the Drop but the music has a different feel thats murkier and perhaps more magic mushrooms than LSD. The tracks have a looser and more lumpy quality than the ones found on BOATS. The standout track for me on this album is “Mother Mother” due to its exceptionally smooth transition from acoustic band into a more synthy electro pulse before fade out.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/floatingpoint/","title":"Floating Points","description":null,"body":"\n\n\n\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/ghost/","title":"Ghost","description":null,"body":"Albums: Impera, Meliora\nHaving seen the Tobias Forge - Ghosts songwriter - on the covers of numerous music mags over the years I initially dismissed them based on the pantomine image. However, having had many of the music distribution channels force the album Imperala down my throat, I’ve come to realise the genius of this spectacle!\nLyrics sang by front man “Papa Emeratis” - the dark pope - are often a timeless tongue in cheek commentary of empires and the circularity of society and politics. The content is poetic, exceptionally perceptive and often humourous. There are degrees of politcis, while also speaking to the darkness of the marginalised as embodied in the music video “cirice”.\nAll in all their discography is pretty good and singles like “Call me Little Sunshine” are excellent. Theres some serious songwriting chops and a deep craft here; in particular “Spillways” is a stand out composition that comes to mind. There are some more subtle easter eggs of Sabbath, Van Halen and Ozzy riffs if you listen carefully to the arrangements as well - particularly on “Watcher in the Sky”. If the these classic rockers had a love child with Abba you’d probably get Ghost, ’cos damn the materials catchy!\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/hilltophoods/","title":"Hilltop Hoods","description":null,"body":"Albums: Hard Road Restrung, State of The Art, Walking Under Stars, Drinking from the Sun, Into the Abyss\nAs the name might suggest, Hilltop are indeed one of Australias biggest hip hop acts - though I’m pretty sure their name came before the fame. Whatever the case it’s well deserved as lyric wise the two MCs are beyond first class wordsmiths. Earlier albums are seemingly less personal and more raw, while later albums are considerably more personal with a pop edge. This is a small price to pay for the added depth and dimensionality and quite frankly the production grows on you.\nWalking Under Stars is probably the darkest period of the bands tenure, with “Live and Let Go” as one of the more profound pieces of lyrical prowess, where guest MC Brother Ali and Pressure drop some lines that are beyond poetic. I’ll not labour how good this group is though, as I’ve a more refined post to drop related to the Hilltop Story.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/justice/","title":"Justice","description":null,"body":"Albums: Woman, HYPERDRAMA\n\nWith dark but colourful aesthetic, the albums Woman and Woman World Wide (its live remix) are a hyperoptimised synthesis of synthesis… oscillating with an impressivly polished sound, the dark saw tooth synths and side chained snares are skillfully blendend with airy pop melodies that seem lush and spacious to the ear.\nThe production is attentive and detailed; if you tune into the warm embrace of the track “Love SOS” you’ll notice a tuned siren which follows the chord progression with a washing white noise generator that laps gently like waves splashing in the background! Everything on this album has a similarly distinct texture which will appeal to folks with a wide musical palette. Oh, and what a spectacle their shows are!\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/killitkid/","title":"Kill it Kid","description":null,"body":"Albums: Kill it Kid, Feet Fall Heavy, You Owe Nothing.\nKill it Kid were a pretty short lived band from Bristol with an evolution that went from bluesy folk to blisteringly hard rock over the course of three albums. Theres a clear tension of unrequited love between the vocalists that seems to build to a breaking point by the third album (they later hooked up and continued as the outfit Ida Mae).\nBoth singers are skilled instrumentalists; Chris Turnpin must have sold his soul to the devil to play guitar in such an authentic manner, while the keyboards have a practiced jazz influence to them (no doubt from a rock school). The rhythm section are arguably there to support the two main stars but they do a professional job, keeping things tight and stylistically appropriate.\nEach album feels pretty complete in it’s own right so it’s perhaps best to think of each as phases of tension, coherent in themselves and in sequence; it was consequentially quite exciting to track the bands career trajectory as it happened in real time - from folk violins to blisteringly heavy rock.\nIf you want to know where to start “Feet Fall Heavy” exhibits the bands best writing across albums, while “Burned in the By &amp; By” was a great Abby Road extra produced at the bands zenith yet sadly never appeared on any album. This is the dial set somewhere in the middle.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/maynardjameskenan/","title":"Maynard James Keenan","description":null,"body":"Bands: Tool, Pusifer, Perfect Circle.\nAlbums: Fear Innoculum, 10,000 Days, Conditions of My Parole, Existential Reckoning, Eat the Elephant,\nMaynard is yet another unrelenting creative, god knows where he gets the energy from but every breath drawn appears to be used towards the creation of something new. From any one of his three bands to his businesses and vineyards. The quality of his output is also extremely high, all the albums listed above sound great and come with all the bells and whistles of premium merch and so forth. A born performer!\nTools last two records are particularly note worthy due to the detailed arrangements and production values. Fear Innoculum in particular has a smooth coalescence that is eloquently whole and complete. If you trace back the bands history it will become quite apparent that this is the finished product; 10,000 days is really strong, though rougher around the edges - as with the albums prior to that. The advantage to these earlier albums however are the esoteric Easter eggs that correlate to fibonnachi ratios, or tracks that can be layered over each other.\nMusically the band is a full package; rhythmically, harmonically, melodically interesting with highly refined messaging. Many of the tracks sound extremely organic due to the odd time signatures like 7/8 or 5/4. This tends to move about as well. Favorite Tool tracks include “Jambi”, “The Pot” and “Vicarious” from 10,000 Days and perhaps “Invincible” or “Decending” from Fear Innoculum though it’s a harder album to pick from due to the self similar cohesiveness of the tracks.\nPuscifer then are another vibe, much less esoteric and more of a comedy show or drama than anything. It’s quite something. You get all sorts of characters and narratives popping out of this setup; seemingly a parody on life, or maybe the three gunas who then give rise to the wheel of samsara. Musically Pusifer are more versitile and experimental than Tool or APC, which has a charming novelty, though at the cost of consistency which is quite honestly advertised as SPAM. Tracks to dig on would be the title track of “Conditions of My Parole”, which is a really solid album with tracks like “Monsoons” “The Weaver”, “Green Valley” and then other tunes like “Bread and Circus” and “Bullet Train to Iowa” from the album Existential Reckoning (#IamTheBriefcase).\nA Perfect Circle are then much closer to Tool than Pusifer. There are a few albums to choose from and they’re all worth a listen, though I’d recommend “Eat the Elephant” as the most mature. In particular the title track stands out as delicate and spacious, while “Disillusioned” has the production, arrangement, lyrics and performance.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/nilerodgers/","title":"Nile Rodgers","description":null,"body":"Albums: Risque, Random Access Memories,\nNile has always churned out hits since the early days of Chic’s “Everybody Dance”, through to Daft Punks “Get Lucky”. What’s most amazing about him is his ability to take complex jazz voicings and create a polished pop masterpiece without a hint of dissonance. Check out his interviews, he’s a wonderful story teller and is living proof that Disco doesn’t suck (though he was somewhat forced into new territories by the movement).\nMyself, I’m a fan of the Chic classics like “Everybody Dance” and “Good times” for the uplifting funk vibes and genere defining style of guitar and bass leading the rhythm section; Bernard Edwards being Niles legendary compatriot on the low end. Absolutely Rocking.\nBesides Chic’s tunes, Nile is pretty much all over the map when it comes to major artists; Madonna, Sister Sledge, Bowie, Duran Duran and so on - though Daft Punk’s last album is for me the most interesting. Of course “Get Lucky” with Pharell Williams was the big splash but “Give Life Back to Music” and “Loose Yourself to Dance” are arguably better pieces of craft.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/robertfripp/","title":"Robert Fripp","description":null,"body":"Albums: In the Court of the Crimson King, Lizard, Red, The Power to Believe\nRobert Fripp of King Crimson is arguably one of the most diciplined musicians out there, practicing six hours a day in order to perform near impossible arrangements like “FracKture” with a triple band lineup consisting of some of the best musicians on the plannet. It’s a pretty impressive lineup!\nThe band made their debut in 1969 with the album “In the Court of The Crimson King” which is their most famous by a long shot - you know, the one with the iconic screaming face. Apparently their first performance of “21st Century Schitzoid Man” in Hyde Park left the audience so disoriented that people forgot to clap the Rolling Stones onto stage!\nFor many years I found “Red” the most appealing album as it feels particularly whole and exhibits some incredible compositions. The album was titled “Red” because the band broke so many formal musical rules that if you submitted it for a music school exam you’d have received the report back full of red crosses. As suggested by such a story, the album breaks boundaries and sounds incredible having been recorded at Air Lyndhurst in London - the studio George Martin (the fifth Beatle) bought and refitted. The tracks “One More Red Nightmare” and “Starless” are in my opinion highlights of the album.\nAnother enthralling album is “The Power to Believe”, which displays quite some virility. It’s a modern album with electronic instruments, bone crushing guitars and some luscious moments of release. The rhythms, textures, compositions and technicality are vital elements of the resultant soundscape. You probably won’t find anything like it anywhere else; incredibly creative and powerful stuff that’s akin to a non-traditional gamelan.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/robertplant/","title":"Robert Plant","description":null,"body":"Album: Mighty Rearranger, Dreamland\nWhile a lot of Robert Plants solo work doesn’t really float my boat, Mighty Rearranger is absolutely fantastic! “Another Tribe” starts the album with a rhythmic vitality that beams sunshine everywhere, which is appropriate given the second track is called “Shine It All Around”. This track is another winner on the production given it’s many layred vocals and huge echo effects on the chorus - hard to believe it was recoded in a small Welsh studio. At the end of the album there’s also a drum and bass remix of this tune which is pretty nice. Roberts not lost his voice or soul even at this stage of his career.\nHonourable mentions as well to the album Dreamland which is also pretty strong; particularly “Darkness, Darkness” and his cover of Dylan’s “One More Cup Of Coffee”. Of course we could add a lot of the Zeppelin stuff here as well but I’m deliberately avoiding review of obvious classics as those trails are known.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/snarkypuppy/","title":"Snarky Puppy","description":null,"body":"Albums: We Like it Here, Family Dinner\nA well composed cosmopolitian fusion of jazz, funk, rock, blues, hip hop, electro and soul. Sounds a bit much right? Well, it’s less about the ingredients than what’s getting cooked with them. Here we have a big band that knows how to tastefully bend and blend genres.\nDepending on the album your listening to the flavour varies. If your into the instrumental hip hop vibes then “We Like It Here” is a great album - plenty of exotic sun and colourful places to explore. The dirty bass line towards the end of “Shofukan” is worth the wait, with complex textures and rolling soundscapes are on the way towards this distination!\nIf your looking for something more traditional big band, with vocals and such, then start with the album “Family Dinner” instead. If you ask me the tracks “Gone Under” and “Fire to Hot to Last” are the jewls of that gathering; funky, sexy and bad to the bone.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/all/","title":"Special Mentions","description":null,"body":"Albums:\nJohn Butler Trio: Grand National\nXavier Rudd: Solace\nMorcheeba: Big Calm\nNightmares on Wax: Smokers Delight\nRodger Chapman: Chappo\nElton John: Tumbleweed Collection\nTracks:\nKate Tempest: Peoples faces\nLovework: Black light smoke\nGlen Gould: Art of Fugue\nPolyphia: G.O.A.T\nSufjan Stevens: Chicago\nSuper Tramp: Crime of the Centuary\nHaruomi Honso: Shin Shin Shin\nGramatik: Hold On\nGUTS: Peacefull life, Rest of My Life\nBooker T.

Despite what some might consider to be a vulgar or crass band name, the musics about as as smooth as it gets and also pretty refined. These virtues come courtesy of the well thought out arrangements, the best jazz musicians of the time in some of the best studios. Apparently a descriptive term applied to them by a journalist at one point or another was “Yacht Rock”, which is quite apt!\nIn funny sort of way, Steely Dan are actually kind of like a cynical version of Byran Wilson. The genius is certainly there with their cream of the crop arrangements, artsy lyrics, unusual instruments and so forth - so the real difference is the tone and taste… Dan as you might suspect are less innocent and a dollop more dark.\nAlbum wise the Royal Scam is probably my favourite of the lot, though Aja is one of the most famous. Cherry picking a few songs the likes of “Dirty Work”, “Fire in the Hole”, “Any Major Dude”, “Kid Charlemagne”, and “The Royal Scam” come to mind.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/stevewilson/","title":"Steve Wilson","description":null,"body":"Albums: Fear of a Blank Planet, In Absentina, Deadwing, Closure/Continuation, The Harmony Codex\nThis list has a number of prolific creators on it as you may have already noticed, and Steve Wilson is no different. Besides his main band Porcupine Tree and his solo career, he is also King Crimsons mix and mastering engineer (amongst many other bands, particularly in Prog).\nPorcupine tree has relatively large discography, though generally speaking I’ve found the cream begins to rise from “Fear of a Blank Planet” onwards. This is roughly the period when Gavin Harrison joined the band, who you might recognise as 1/3 of Crimsons Rhythm section; naturally he is one a hell of a drummer.\nGuitars, synths, bass and vocals are all arranged tastefully across Wilsons work too. Things tend to get more jazzy as Porcupine Tree ages, though that’s not to say that C/C is soft by any means. This is evidenced by the extremely gritty telecasters on tracks like “Rats Return” which is a bone crusher of a riff… Not to mention “Herd Culling”.\nTrying out Wilsons solo stuff you’ll find that it’s more eclectic; the Harmony Codex being more electronic in nature though it’s still characteristic of his unique style with complex vocal harmonies and textured layers. The videos are also quite creative, especially the one for his AI generated Christmas song “December Skies” or “Economies of Scale”.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/sturgilsimpson/","title":"Sturgill Simpson","description":null,"body":"Albums: Sailors Guide to Earth, Sound and Fury\nSomething more less jazz you say? Ok, well, Sturgil keeps things safe by keeping to familiar progressions and standard time signatures, though he does a fantastic job of making them interesting. He even recognises and discloses the recursivity of his writing in the lyrics of “All Said and Done”!\n\nKeep staring at the pages, coming up with the same lines,It’s all been said and done by now, two or three times.\n\nThis however is not surprising (as he knows how to wield the pen) because the line is also symbolic of the essence of his breakthrough album which was title called “Meta-modern Sounds in Country Music”. Yep, psychedelic country music. You can’t find a larger market than country music so he pretty much nailed the business strategy for going mainstream! (intentional or otherwise)\nHinted at by the album title “A Sailors Guide to Earth” and reading between the lines of “Welcome to Earth Pollywog” and “Keep Between The Lines” it seems pretty obvious that the albums intended as a time capsule for his newborn child. In particular I’d recommend the track “Brace For Impact” for its lyrics framed by a particularly solid bass line chugging the title into life (what a shaker in the chorus!). The motown vibe throughout this album also has an authenticity to it akin to the Muscle Shoals sound.\nIf your a fan of the Danger Mouse sound (Black Keys), then you’ll appreciate the production of Sound and Fury, which exemplifies the style - for instance painting in the drums of “Best Clock Maker on Mars” which has a precise and unrelenting shuffle. The aesthetic of switching radio stations is pretty creative too and reminds me of Pink Floyds “Wish You Were Here”. Once the blistering guitars get too intense (they do), your treated to some melting moments of release like in the tune “Make Art, Not Friends”; as such I’d suggest sticking with the tension and listening to the album straight through from start to finish… oh and “Remember to Breathe”! ;)\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/sylvainrichards20syl/","title":"Sylvain Richards (20SYL)","description":null,"body":"Albums: Tetra, The Upper Hand\nSylvain Richard is the multi-potentiate creator behind Hocus Pocus, C2C, 20syl, Alltta and a number of other artistic endevours. He’s also a semi-pro skater and screen printer!\nThe flavour of C2C is pretty characteristic of Richards distinct style but as a team of turntabilists, the group won the World DMC Championship enough times to get banned from competing. The tracks have a flavour of funky electronic disco and seems to satisfy most peoples tastes in any group gathering. It also consistently breaks the mould enough for those who desire texture, novelty and refinement in their music.\nRichards other stuff is solid too; most if not all of his productions feel sonically well polished and are often delivered with a simple but well designed and creative video like “Kodema” or “The Beat”. If you want a groove you’ll find that C2C and 20syl has enough rythmic elements churned with modern synthesis to warm up most crowds; for example “Can You Dance To This”?\nSome other hot picks not to miss out on are “Down The Road”, “Back &amp; Forth” and “Le Banquet”.

Joni Mitchell helps as a backing singer. This tune with Joni Michell on backing is certainly one of the gigs highlights along with “Caravan”, “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down”, “The Weight” and many of the bands other original songs like “Arcadian Driftwood”.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/wolfmother/","title":"Wolfmother","description":null,"body":"Album: Cosmic Egg\nOxymoronically, “Cosmic Egg” is what might be called contemporary classic rock; if you like layers of multi-tracked guitars, this albums full of psychedelic phasers, wah peddles and possibly double necked Gibson SGs.

After listening through a couple of times the album really grew on me and I’ll happily say that Wolfmother are innovating in a field with little room left to maneuver - Cosmic Egg being the jewel in their discography.\nPersonally speaking, I’m favorable to the ralentandos (tempo shifts) and arpeggios on “Eyes Open” and “Violence of the Sun”.

One project per page, currently sorted by title.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/portfolio/adaptivecapital/","title":"Adaptive Capital","description":null,"body":"Adaptive Capial Proposal\nTokenomics Proposal: “Adaptive Capital“\nBackground\nWe are essentially proposing an ecosystem level partnership between Regen Network and Protocol Labs through the mutual funding of a Tokenomics DAO. This comes from our teams desire to bridge the gap between research and implementation.\nThe proposal below outlines the current state of our implementation plan and we are soliciting discussion and feedback for further advancement. There is plenty of scope for improvement, which we trust will happen as we advance our work. We believe that the proposal submitted to PL can help lay strong research foundations; while Regen is fertile soil for technical implementation that contributes to grounded impact in real communities.\nSpecifications\nRegen Registry defines Nature Based Solutions in the following manner:\n\n“Adaptive Capital” is subsequently a proposition for valuing living ecosystems through multi-perspective architecture and the free energy principal; a means of evaluating quantitive measures with qualitative outcomes. For such a project to find traction, we need to consider the existential domains of markets, science and technology; while holding in mind the essential values of people, planet and protocols. Let’s explore our assumptions about these domains:\nMarket Assumptions Markets are seeking pathways for divestment from degenerate commodities to more regenerative investment vehicles. However the divestment is constrained by a lack of said pathways and it’s estimated that there are two trillion dollars of stranded assets trading on Wall St. books. In the authors opinion this number represents a transformation opportunity thats global in scale provided we can address the markets pain points with integrity. Please see the RFP-X Research doc for a more detailed contextual framing on this subject.\nScientific Assumptions When it comes to addressing the markets with integrity, we need to incorporate truth claims and anchor this context. The methods used and the claims made are important; Popper believed science was about the raw explanatory power and predictive capacity of a framework, while Khun thought of it as a community of practice.\nIn our view both authors are correct; reason can thought of as rational proof (deductive knowledge utilising the Baconian methodology) and as empiric verification (inductive wisdom through the Goethian methodology). Consequentially the ReSci movement might consider integrating both these fundamental approaches to making truth claims by leveraging abductive reasoning and Bayesian methods. These base predictions on known priors before feeding forward to infer likely outcomes.\nTechnological Assumptions From a practical standpoint the story of digital communication begins with Claude Shannons information theory; binary 1’s and 0’s that convey state. Beyond Shannon’s fundamental theory of bits and bytes, there are new innovations that abstract his binary domain into a trinary lens of “agents, languages and perspectives” where agents, speaking their language of preference, express perspectives on ‘Truth claims’.\nAs a technical architecture, such a ‘meta ontology’ enables us to encode other frameworks as ‘perspectives’, and in particular we believe that encoding “general systematics” is a particularly powerful epistemological framework that can act as a functional backbone for articulating parameter groupings in a transparent way.\nApplied at the interface level these functional frameworks can be used to generate a consistent set of active inference models that enable the composable encoding of practice based methodologies, eco-credits, accounting methodologies, evaluation criteria, sensor networks APIs, DAOs and far beyond. Such architecture is particularly elegant as it enables semantic translation and ad hoc composibility for an apples to oranges comparison of quantitive measures to qualitative values.\nInfrastructure Design\nLet’s frame the high level design abstractions we will lean on in relation to our ends: These could more sensibly be framed as:\n\nMarkov blankets act as a form of general substrate that can then be further systematised with metadata to enable semantic interoperability - this is a highly general medium that is analogus to merkle trees and hash graphs. In Regens case this technical infrastructure is represented by the data module.\nAn Impact certificate essentially articulates a given methodology in a machine readable format. These certificates represent a set of means, while evaluation criteria codified in a similar format can express values as ends. For example - when it comes to open science - there is a growing movement towards making papers more accessible by encoding them as ‘conversation graphs’; this might be represented in a tetradic geometry with nodes representing:\n\nExtrapolating such a concept one step further it’s easy enough to imagine a form of bespoke facilitation where the content of any conversation can be functionally represented as geometries to support the processes of communal understanding.\nWhen a discussion reaches consensus on credit class, methodology, DAO design, evaluation criteria etc. we can use the interface to easily store and anchor data on chain. Any subsequent dialogue can be self-managed by the community, easily updating their credit design parameters through their governance process through a simple interface. Supporting conversation and data can be aggregated as a form of composable capital to be issued as eco-credits which would democratise access to technology in a significant way. Such a process can even be turned into art or gamified to make the process fun and rewarding!\nBelow the interface level comes the functional specifications for on chain integration. Using the AD4M ontology we can integrate general systematics to describe a set of metadata standards. From there we can describe both the data module and eco-credit modules as ‘languages’ and ‘perspectives’ in order to make them interoperable with other systems architectures. For added precision, we may wish to add other ontological ‘perspectives’ for translating quantity (data module claims like MRV) to quality (eco-credit attestations like REA).\nIn the case of the latter Resource, Event, Agent accounting is a particularly useful ontology to integrate as its institutionally recognised accounting standard for distributed supply chains. This might then use feeds from Monitoring, Reporting and Verification technologies as evaluation criteria for impact certificates. The elegance of this design is that if these standards are changed or extended, they can be easily recomposed or updated.\nFor example we can extend the triadic geometry MRV to be a tetradic geometry for a more detailed resolution. The following was articulated by dMeter community members:\n\nUltimately whatever indicators are at desirable can be articulated through General Systematics and codified as Markov blankets to unlock the capabilities of semantically composable impact markets. These functional models can then be enriched with Active Inferencing to provide a more detailed depth of resolution.\nPilot Tokenomic Mechanism(s): Adaptive Capital\nThe architecture above is designed at the level of general infrastructure and can be used for composing any desirable credit design, which is dependent on the articulation of parametric groupings instantiated around a use case or pilot project.

What determines the quality, quantity and intensity of this phenomena? Can answers be harnessed towards human flourishing at personal, local and global levels?\nWhile I have no clear answers, we might be able to draw some inferences based on John Bennetts lifetime of studies, in particular his schema of the twelve energy levels. These have also been taught at H3uni.org by Anthony Hodgson as part of the Cosmic Ecology course.\nHaving attempted to climb the mountain of John Bennetts Dramatic universe series myself, I can share from experience it’s an exceptionally dense rock of knowledge. The book “energies; material, vital, cosmic” is a set of crumbs from that ideas table, and significantly more digestible for such a reason - in other words what a bloody great book!\nEssentially the book is a set of lectures about Bennett’s twelve levels of energy and the pentadic diagrams used to articulate the eight cosmoses of reciprocal maintenance. As Gurdjieff would have put it, this schema is about learning “to do” through the “laws of world creation and maintenance” - though the material is more informative than pragmatic.\nWhat I mainly took from this book is a correction to my thinking process and some fresh inspiration for thinking about questions like “what is photosynthesis?” or “does free energy exist?”. Here Bennett’s descriptions of energetic levels and his systematic methodology for considering the relationships opens up a field of fresh insights, where in biology or the standard model of physics seems to get stuck.\nInvestigating material energies, we get some interesting relationships, and it may essentially be that Bennett outlines the keys to Teslas free energy as the crystalline cosmos. At the very least he seems to be waaay ahead of the curve detailing what appears to be extropic.ai’s hardware acceleration.\nIn this case the crystalline cosmos is composed of five energies; E12 dissipative, E11 directed, E10 cohesive, E9 tensile, E8 vital. The names are descriptive of their qualities, though can be substituted with other attributes, which help to further clarify their essence.\nSo by recycling heat, directing it, organising it, concentrating it and releasing it in a desired pattern an anabolic reaction is created. At the same time, inefficiencies in fitting the pattern and so forth creates a catabolic reaction which produces waste in the form of heat. It would seem that this can be maintained in perpetuity by a ‘sorting daemon’ which requires little if any energetic input by simply skimming the necessary energy from flows occurring between chambers, which is illustrated in the book.\nIn theory this sounds good but we still might want to test it out, although retroductivly drawing on personal experience it seems about on point regarding cycles of hyperstimulation and burn out. Coincidentally, in Bennetts schema of energies this ‘burn out’ modality may actually be the excessive weight of higher energies like conscious energy which is likened to a black flame, or the sun in Platos cave where those exposed to such energy wish to withdraw back into the comfort of darkness… Couldn’t tell you, but talk about an interesting reframe!\nSo that’s it for the book review, we can probably discuss the subject of energies in significantly more depth by using methods like systematics and qualsystems to tease out links and relationships between the modalities. The subject of another post however!\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/books/caravanofdreams/","title":"Caravan of dreams","description":null,"body":"","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/books/trueperception/","title":"True Perception","description":null,"body":"True Perception was a book I was given for Christmas about Dharma art. Given the name you’d be forgiven for thinking its a book about art, though in many ways it is, more appropriately it’s about the art of right living - with art as the vehicle.\nTrungpas is an eloquent writer and his content is easy to read; this is in part probably due to his clear semantic framing, though he rarely settles for stable definitions instead offering multiple perspectives on the same thought object.\nAn example of this is the definition of “Dharma Art” itself which he describes in three different ways within the first chapter alone:\n\nnon-aggression and total confidence,\nunselfconsciousness and directness,\nvision and operation.\n\nHere he makes it clear that art is not supposed to be exhibitionism, which is clumsy and aggressive, instead he asserts that it should be the production of beauty - though not at the expense of others. He draws a distinction between Dharma Art and elegance, and that work for others brings delight while work on the self brings elegance. This brings out what is honest, real and earthy.\nFrom here we move into a discussion on vision; differentiating between “Great Eastern Sun” and “Setting Sun” - which are defined from a number of perspectives.\nGreat Eastern Sun is:\n\nFearless (Power, energy, strength)\nWakeful (No doubt, hesitation or regret)\nBrilliant (all pervasive goodness)\n\nThis vision is also described as having a sense of dignified confidence that is peaceful and non-aggression. Trungpa says that Great Eastern sun is a fearless victory over the three worlds of man, heaven and earth - though peaceful and shows the path, so we must develop ourselves first before we can properly engage.\nDue to this development, there forms a goodness in the self which projects decency and creates trust with an audience due to the purpose of affirming an enlightened society. This wakefulness consists of luminosity, energy and brilliance - without doubts, hesitations or regrets.\nSetting Sun on the other hand is described as a lack of bravery and complete cowardice, a constant fear that’s deliberately suicidal and wants to go to sleep; this is egoistic passion, ignorance and aggression.\nThis brings us on to the notion of “Basic Goodness” which is foundation of man heaven and earth. Man in particular should be generous and brave (dyad), wakeful, open minded and enlightened (triad) - which is the first set of Bhuddist iconographies.\nIt would seem that this gives rise to harmony which is described as plentiful, rich and minimal. Or alternatively as luscious, rich, open and spacious; “like a Jewish mother in a Japanese home” - which is in itself a pretty fearless caricature.\nTo reach such basic goodness Trungpa asserts that a meditation practice is needed; preferably in the Shamatha Vipashyana tradition, which means ‘mindful’ and ‘aware’. The realisation being that Form and Dharma are non existent and therefore cant mix, similarly there is a fuzzy boundary between openness and action. In this way art is an awareness practice that opens perspective to create focus, as opposed to a mindfulness excersize. This “Art in Everyday Life” is non possessive and non aggressive.\nBy the time we get to the chapter on “Ordinary Truth” we are at a point where we are prepared for the discussion of theistic symbolism and non theistic symbolism… or as Trungpa puts it “cosmic trips” and “everything has a place”… yes, it seems that’s indeed a shot in the foot for this blog. Oh dear.\nRegardless, this is elaborated on in the chapter “Empty Gap of Mind” as Absolute symbolism (no reference point) and Relative symbolism (symbolic references). The former is passionless, egoless and has no discursive thought. The latter he claims is based on passion, demandingness, restlessness and aggression.\nAbsolute symbolism, Trungpa claims, has a nature like the sky or space, in that it’s unborn and unceasing, though it lives in the hearts of all sentient beings. It cannot happen if there’s no place to birth it, hence a nature like space - or eternity.\nFrom this place we start to “colour our world” which is essentially letting go of the ego, or little “I” of aggression, passion and ignorance (setting sun). Ignorance being a state of basic panic, pain and bewilderment that stem from an allergy towards ourselves.\nHaving discarded these maladies, we begin to develop new sight and see things clearly, properly and directly. But what does “the process of perception” represent? That seems tricky…\n\n“The question of reality is confusing. Nobody knows. But everybody knows that somebody knows…”\n\nIf nobody knows but there is an answer out there somewhere, we have to rely on ourselves and learn to develop our own capacity to interpret ideas, suggestions and information. Reality is both comforting and confusing for these reasons as the real world is full of anxiety, pain and chaos. Trungpas remedy is a sitting practice to make friends with ourselves. He suggests that from such a place of non-aggression we can begin to see things without making demands and trying to buy or sell to others.\nIn this chapter, it would be wise to take Trungpas advice of thinking for ourselves onboard when he offers a description on how our perceptive process unfolds.\nFirstly he suggests that we see an object, secondly we mentally smell it as some kind of commentator comes along in the back of our head, then we hear the object from all around, before finally forming a relationship with it through touch and making some kind of judgement or decision. Indeed this seems based on the four term system of the “Karmas”, and such systems are representative of actions and decisions, rather than a full blown process of perception - which would likely take the form of a seven fold system.\nWith that caveat noted, Trungpas position that Dharma Art’s not really concerned with this “process”, at the end of the chapter, actually makes a lot more sense. This he suggests is like a frog sitting in the rain as a puddle forms around it with what amounts to essential indifference. However this doesn’t explain the process of perception as promised by the chapter title, though the next chapter “Being and Projecting” moves us towards such an understanding.\nThis begins with a description of the 12 Ayatanas, which are a symbolic reference to the sense perceptions and sense objects. The perceptions are thinking, seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, tasting, while the correspondent objects are mind, eye, ear, body, nose and tongue.\nIf we start with this position of “Frog in the Rain” or a sense of essential indifference, Trungpa suggests that we begin to project ourselves outwards in order to prove our existence, which then leads to a dance with the projection as it begins to unfold.\nReading between the lines here, we can determine that there are the six sense perceptions through which the dynamics of projector and projected interact. When placed together, this seems to form the outline of an enneagram; a triad within a broken hexad. Perhaps this implicitly gives rise to the “process of perception” promised by the chapter title? From the fragmets at the end of the page it would seem so.\nThe next chapter on “Lost Horizons” seems in many ways contradictory to Trungpas earlier statements - though the information still seems relevant; he starts by discussing relative symbolism and says “this does not refer to some superspiritual-materalistic vision based on altered neurological perceptions. It simply means an experience that transcends the common phenomena of good and bad, promises and threats” - which is effectively a 180º turn from the earlier affirmation that it was a “Cosmic Trip”.\nThis updated view suggests that it’s a form of visual perception developed through meditation and “without such taming of the mind, we either misjudge situations or are overpowered by them. We are unable to percieve things as they are in the fullest sense”. This feels like a more tempered perspective, given Trungpas own cognitive semantics are a form of relative symbolism. At the same time we can also note a change of attitude from being (‘frog in the rain’, ‘sitting bull’) to doing, such as jumping into “brilliant high energy pools” - though this is still distinguished from beautiful, fantastic and colourful.\n\nThe Tibeten Book of the Dead also says that if you go along with the bright and penetrating visions, you might be saved; whereas if you are facinated by the beautiful, fantastic, colorful visions, you might be trapped in the samsaric rebirth cycle again and again.\n\nIts worth paying close attention to the semantics of the words used at this point as for a laymen like myself the terms can be easily conflated. It seems the words bright and penetrating are likely used in reference to the five wisdoms; mirror like awareness, discernment, sameness, knowlege of the phenomenological dimension and acomplishment. Rather than what Trungpa would probably call a ‘Cosmic Trip’ (as beautifully illustrated by this very site ;).\nWhatever the case this chapter is a radical call out about substituting the real for the imaginary, and never quite catching the fish in the net. What Trungpa calls the lost horizon, which sends a few shocks.\nThe remedy to this he suggests is “Giving”, though this is not what you might think it means. The chapter starts by noting that the desire to learn more and more is questionable as a form of agression is taking place and how such posessive demands makes us deaf, dumb and blind - a veil preventing absolute symbolism.\nInsted Trungpa recomends giving up, opening up and surrender as a means of ridding ourselves of agression. Paradoxically, this may actually mean giving into agression in order to let it go because you couldn’t care less. It consequentially seems the point is giving in all senses, exhaling everything to the point that scales fall from your eyes and your (true) perception becomes clear, direct and precice.\n\n“Once we stop rejecting the world, it begins to pounce on us. Symbolism is imposed on us”\n\nNow, we get into the realm of “self existing humour”, which as a first principal is otherwise cosmic and breaks down the distinction between you and I. The ground from which it arises is a sense of all pervasive space or ground thats not messed up, paired with an appreciation of the play of phenomenona - perhaps otherwsise termed “Lila”.\nFor me this resonates, as I’ve been many characters in the course of my journey and am starting to see them back. By no means do I have mirror like awareness, but at times I find myself getting frustrated at charaters I’ve been before - which when noticed on reflection is actually quite a hillarious CirKus or cosmic ecology!\nThis really is an odd teapot of energetics, totally nuts, but bringing it back to Trungpa he suggests that peaceful energy is harmless, benevolent and pacifying - arising from warmth and encouragement. While wrathful energy is mocking and exposing. Sometimes our caricuture is savage and deadly, other times dignified and powerful. It’s not a lonely trip either, somebody else has been through it before and in many ways it’s all an act - yet an entirely real one!\nFrom here we move into a chapter called “Outrageousness” which seems to be the existential pole related to the essence of “non-agression”. Trungpa defines outrageousness as a direct conviction with a feeling of intense humour, energy and power penetrating inside - which makes a good deal of sense from the cosmic perspective of mirror like wisdom. There are a couple of traps here of course in relation to self-centredness, aggression and self-consciousness; in particular the presentation of the art or truth one has discovered (or is discovering).\n\n“The basic point is that there is a sense of continuity in your understanding of life. If you know who you are, what you are, where you are, and have something to say about that, you could share it with your fellow human beings. That’s fine. There’s nothing wrong with that, as long as you don’t want to publicize it. And even if you do want to publicize your embryonic discoveries, you don’t spell out the whole thing at once. It’s very tempting to spell everything out, which proves one’s legitimacy, one’s wisdom, or one’s artistry.”\n\nOutrageousness instead seems to be a sense of fearless celebration, which leads smoothly into the chapter on being a “Wise Fool”, who is open and inquisitive without frivolity or aggression; in other words a connection with reality and the phenomenal world that’s proper, gentle and generous.\nIn learning to interact with the world essentially, the discussion moves on to the “Five Styles of Creative Expression”. In many ways however, it may be better to interpret this core iconography as four styles with a neutral middle - which represents the all encompassing spaciousness and basic ground of the Bhudda (symbolised by the colour blue). We then have four other semantic coordinates.\n\n\nVajra, representing water with its clear and precise reflections. Its crisp like winter with colours of blue, white and gold. Its austere, cold and desolate, aliminium and metalic. It is the dawn rising in the east.\n\n\nRatna, representing earth with equinamity thats expansive and extending. It has a crisp Autumnal yellow to it. A rich and powerful sense of giving that’s dignified, opulent and regal, as well as a fertile, restless, earthyness thats solid and definite. It has a southern orientation.\n\n\nPadma, representing fire with a discriminating perception that sees detail. It has a spring facade to it that is red. It has no solidity or texture but is full of colour and glamour. It is concerned with output rather than input, with no concern to health or survival. It is connected with sunset and values reflection over being, art over science and practicality. It is brilliant, lucious and colourful, curvy and shapely like a lotus with a connection to wild flowers and roaming animals.\n\n\nKarma, representing wind and the automatic fulfilment of action. It’s colour is a summer green. It’s efficient, self-maintaining, active and growing with a sense of competition towards birthing something. Consequentially it has a sense of thunder and hail that can feel demonic and black, like a panther or understanding a thunder cloud.\n\n\nInverse to enlightened states, these houses also have neurotic states:\nBhudda can be spaced out rather than spacious\nVajra can be angry with intellectual fixation and ridgidity\nRatna can be fat and ostentatious, indulged to insanity\nPadma can be overly passionate, grasping, posessive with a desire to seduce the world\nKarma can be jealous, comparative and envious.\nBeyond this Trungpa distinguishes three levels of perception; experience, emptyness and luminosity. Experience just is - where “white is white” - while emptyness can be vacant or overcrowded (paradoxically leaving a lot of room, due to all the jostling life), lumonisoty then is something thats realised on the spot; which I personally interpet along the lines of creative improvisation - though it may be otherwise.\nHe says that perceptions are shifty, that they cant be reduced to words so much as their articulation takes us further from the reality - yet they are sharp, precise and tend to bring clarity. Open awareness should have a sense of connectivity, that everything is related to everything.\nIn choiceless magic he starts to speak of individuality, and with it the sense of confusion, uncertainty and chaos that arises. Here we have the choice of using the anxiety by making everything smooth, beautiful and fantastic - or turning the world into a training groundto learn more, which is suggested as preferable. This seems point at the experience of absolote symbology.\nOne key point in this chapter is in relation to the unification of everything, a group of individuals forming an organisation where everybody gets ‘turned on’ he considers a trip as such uniformity neglects individuality; in other words a consensus that “we are all playing the same game” is not considered Bhuddadharma. Same for the emulation of individuality.\nWith all this said, Trungpa does assert that there is a basic iconographic pattern to the universe, and that the intention should be to heighten individuality within the framework of some common world - which gets acknowleged as problematic at this point. Probably because of questions regarding frame.\nAt this point, my mind wanders into the teachings offered at H3uni.org and John Bennets work on General Systematics aka Qualsystems. Indeed, here is a community of individuals here holding a toolbelt of common frames; such frames are indeed a method of compressing and expressing reality into a low dimensional topology - much like bhuddist iconography.\nSuch models are useful in that they enable communication - though of course higher dimensional topologies do exist (like reality itself). “In the end, all barriers are broken through and bondages ‘annihilated’ - at that point there is room for that and this to be one”. Of course, such a perspective also has wider implications in relation to wholeness, morality, and the wider psychological enviroment of humanity.\n“One Stroke” continues along these lines with a discussion on forms of culture; pure culture derived from lineage and noncultural aesthetic expressions of meditation and devotion. This takes us into modern times and the lack of artistic lineage; since we lack a real teacher student relationship, Trungpa suggests the best path forward is to meditate a lot so that things become clearer and we develop a sense of continuity, dignity and mindfulness. Inspiration then comes from opensess and clear vision - the original Buhdda mind which is blank, nonterritorial, noncompetative and open.\nFrom this place it seems we can partake in “The Activity of Nonagression”, from which dignity emerges - a sense of gentleness and authentic-presence, which enables four actions or karmas. These seem to be synonomous with the Bhudda families above, with some expansion on the terms.\nPacifying has a sense of pure perception without sharp edges, and is related to a blue circle. Blue is related to pure sky with lots of space, and pure fresh air. Gentle and innately good, absent of neurosis and sees the world at its best.\nEnriching has a sense of richness, depicted as a yellow square with sharp corners. This relates to earth which creates boundaries for us, though also direction and has a sense of being, harmony and a well settled situation. There is also dignity, which relates to the intrinsic energy of our mind and mental state.\nMagnetising is depicted as a red half circle which is representative of emotions connected to the square earth, rounding it with reference points. This brings out passion, like an embrace or kiss, though also the meeting of minds. Richness without poverty allowing us to let go and be generous.\nKarma is depicted as a green triangle connected with activity and destruction. Green represents the strength and power of wind that is fearless. The triangle represents a dynamic balance between positive, negative and neutral - too much fearlessness becomes intellectual, too little becomes cowardice, which points to reconciling balance. Destruction relates to liberation and freedom as well, making it simple and clean cut.\nBy combining these colours we get lemon yellow and purple, imperial colours across history; the former connected with strength and the king principal, the latter with the ultimate feminine or queen principal.\nNow we arrive at a “State of Mind”, a form of wakeful magic that arises from our attitude in relation to ourselves, others and the world. Art involving a relation to ourselves and our phenomenal world gracefully. Grace implies none agression, gentleness and upliftedness - the basic attributes of cheerfulness, which enable us to beautify the world.\nWhere things go wrong is poverty - as despite talent, inteligence and vision artists have to struggle for money. Attitude and integrity become important. Trungpa suggest starting without the aim of money making, pure craft, and in working with others they begin to notice you as genuine, interesting, dedicated and brave. From such a place of gentle goodness, dedication and trueness, our work rises to another dimension - one that is uplifting visually, audibly and psychologically - visual Dharma that gives one a sense of composure that inspires richness, beauty and decorum. This can then hold the world together without causing schism.\nSeeing is distinguished from looking; first thought best thought, second thought maybe preferable. Impressions and then going beyond with a threefold logic of perception, appreciation and presentation; the ground, the path and then fruition. This logic can also be seen as the heaven, earth, human principal or the bodies of Tibetean vajrayana Bhuddism - dharmakaya, sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya. However they are described, they can be seen as background manifestation, potential manifestation and finally manifesting altogether.\nIn the Shambala tradition its “Heaven, Earth, Human”:\n\n\nHeaven is the coming down to earth with a sense of goodness, gentleness and togetherness. Looking down and conquering space with an unyeilding regality thats open and playful. The darkside is that tripping out on it could con you into situations through self-deception, so best start with first mind best mind - just a little dot on a blank page like primordial consciousness thats wakeful, delighted and briliant. From this state of mind and the right attitude and experience of space, comes what is known as blessing or sacredness. With no struggle we can relax and discover the sacred world without being smart or clever, whether mathmatically, technically or politically. This sacredness binds the heaven principle.\n\n\nEarth is then grounded and encompassing. Its first principal is the ‘absence of neurosis’ - defined as fixation or clinging that can be further articulated as passion which is too gluey or gooey, agression which is too sharp, threatening or rejecting, and ignorance, which is a state of stupour that cant discriminate black from white. As it is absent qualities the second principal suggests its ‘thorougly relaxed, soft and wholesome’. The third principal is ‘absence of lazyness’ so has a certain drive to achieve - no half-visions - as that would be breaking the morality and dicipline of artistic endevour. However as Earth is so gentle however, it may become overly domestic, or accomodating of everything - including chaos.\n\n\nHuman has two principals, the first being ‘freedom from subconscious gossip’; if our minds are full of thought it is due to a lack of relation to the heaven or earth principals. Executing work is one way to cut this. The second principal is ‘absence of regret’ be they in the past or future, looking back and forward all the time as a kind of slick but deep rooted depression that obscures heaven and earth - making us unproductive. The Human principal need not reference either heaven or earth, its just individual existence taking place, but when it does to binds heaven and earth together the universal monarch emerges. This king principal arises as a dynamic all three dharmas. Going back to “Basic Goodness” you might in other languages say this is the alchemical child; one that is both cute and daring, yet with openness and strength!\n“Endless Richness” emerges from this reconcilliation and things begin to flow. Like any craft you work with a technique for a long time and it then falls away. You just relate to the object of perception and adapt when things go wrong. An example of a participative movie is offered, which would require the interrelation of a lot of space, speed and richness. Which should make suggestions rather than feed information so they have to work and think about the presentation. Just a corner of knowlege.\nThis modality is related to teaching. Someone doing so by information alone may say wise and beautiful things, yet not know how to handle the gaps. Someone that lives the teaching however won’t fidget or blush, the teaching is engrained in their being so theres no embarassment at mistakes, things just go on and on, like waves of the ocean in endless richness. You recieve a lot, without feeling ‘dumped on’ because theres clearly much more to be said.\n\n\n“Back to square one” points at a moon that in turn points back at us with a mirror like essence. We shape our world in accord with our ideas, beliefs and dreams, which in turn haunt us and shape our being. He says that people get trapped in this creation and get trapped, seeing it as unjustified or undeserved. We then go so far as to discuss the suestion of spirituality, the ultimate level of judgement and the question of being fair to everybody. Perhaps this is the metaphor of Hungry ghosts?\nThinking before action is advised, though like everything this unfolds into questions of how to think, what to think about, why to think and so forth as you can think anything you want. He suggests that it should be directed, but not with dogma, philosophy or concepts. Instead we are “Back to Square One” - who or what thinks and whats the thinking process? It seems we must see ourselves and our thoughts to be genuinely uncoloured. Square one “is what it is”; desolate, spacious and without feedback. When we are forced to pounce, which will happen, we mess it all up - so staying with it and holding our ground seems to be the lesson, especially as theres no way to get out.\n\nWhen you have one, that indicates that you have two and three and four. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that you are going to get to square two and the rest of it. Then you have zero, which is not any kind of figure. It denotes nothing, I suppose. We want to be something, right? Even if we are back to square one, we are there, we are somethi. We dont’t wish te be nothing and we constantly try to avoid that. That is the problem. So the only alternative–not even alternative, but only choice, so to speak–is to be zero. So square one is the basic ground from which we function, and square zero seems to be beyound even our functioning. Isness, without any definitions. It is not so much branching out, but branching in. There is still resistance to going back to zero, and it has always been a problem that square one could be the excuse for you not to have to go back to zero. At least you have the number one to clench on to; at leas there’s that first number you made. You achieved your identity at square one, and that seems to be the problem. So ultimately, one has to return to zero. Then you begin to feel that you can move around. You can do a lot of things, not be numbered. You’re not subject to your own numbers, and you are not confined to a pidgeonhole. So your situation can be improved if you know that you have nothing bet vero, which is nothing. There’s no referenc point anymore, just zero. Try it. It is an expression of immense generosity and immense enlightenment.\n\nFrom zero, we can go to one - “Art Begins At Home” - Dharma art as natural awareness. Phrased another way, the Greek word “oikos” comes to mind, which is the root of economy and ecology. How we do one small thing is how we do everything - hence Dharma Art as a state of natural awareness.\nPerhaps this is the “Human” principal, which reconciles “Heaven and Earth”? Why do we label ourselves artists? Or cling to our mediums? Trungpa suggests that Dharma means “norm” or “truth” that is at peace and cool, reducing the heat of neurosis - a state before touching our brush or instrument.\n\n“For instance, you might go up in the mountains and catch a baby monkey and bring him home, hoping that little baby monkey can play on your shoulder, run around your courtyard, and play in your kitchen. You hope he will relieve your claustrophobia, the heat of your neurosis. When he first decides to come along with you, that baby monkey might behave himself. But over time he begins to become an extension of our neurosis… the same way as your artwork does”\n\nTalent then comes from the appreciation of basic beauty and basic goodness arising from the fundemental peace and coolness of dharma, at which point conflict begins to subside to clear perception.
