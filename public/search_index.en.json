This comes from our teams desire to bridge the gap between research and implementation.\nThe proposal below outlines the current state of our implementation plan and we are soliciting discussion and feedback for further advancement. There is plenty of scope for improvement, which we trust will happen as we advance our work. We believe that the proposal submitted to PL can help lay strong research foundations; while Regen is fertile soil for technical implementation that contributes to grounded impact in real communities.\nSpecifications\nRegen Registry defines Nature Based Solutions in the following manner:\n\n“Adaptive Capital” is subsequently a proposition for valuing living ecosystems through multi-perspective architecture and the free energy principal; a means of evaluating quantitive measures with qualitative outcomes. For such a project to find traction, we need to consider the existential domains of markets, science and technology; while holding in mind the essential values of people, planet and protocols. Let’s explore our assumptions about these domains:\nMarket Assumptions Markets are seeking pathways for divestment from degenerate commodities to more regenerative investment vehicles. However the divestment is constrained by a lack of said pathways and it’s estimated that there are two trillion dollars of stranded assets trading on Wall St. books. In the authors opinion this number represents a transformation opportunity thats global in scale provided we can address the markets pain points with integrity. Please see the RFP-X Research doc for a more detailed contextual framing on this subject.\nScientific Assumptions When it comes to addressing the markets with integrity, we need to incorporate truth claims and anchor this context. The methods used and the claims made are important; Popper believed science was about the raw explanatory power and predictive capacity of a framework, while Khun thought of it as a community of practice.\nIn our view both authors are correct; reason can thought of as rational proof (deductive knowledge utilising the Baconian methodology) and as empiric verification (inductive wisdom through the Goethian methodology). Consequentially the ReSci movement might consider integrating both these fundamental approaches to making truth claims by leveraging abductive reasoning and Bayesian methods. These base predictions on known priors before feeding forward to infer likely outcomes.\nTechnological Assumptions From a practical standpoint the story of digital communication begins with Claude Shannons information theory; binary 1’s and 0’s that convey state. Beyond Shannon’s fundamental theory of bits and bytes, there are new innovations that abstract his binary domain into a trinary lens of “agents, languages and perspectives” where agents, speaking their language of preference, express perspectives on ‘Truth claims’.\nAs a technical architecture, such a ‘meta ontology’ enables us to encode other frameworks as ‘perspectives’, and in particular we believe that encoding “general systematics” is a particularly powerful epistemological framework that can act as a functional backbone for articulating parameter groupings in a transparent way.\nApplied at the interface level these functional frameworks can be used to generate a consistent set of active inference models that enable the composable encoding of practice based methodologies, eco-credits, accounting methodologies, evaluation criteria, sensor networks APIs, DAOs and far beyond. Such architecture is particularly elegant as it enables semantic translation and ad hoc composibility for an apples to oranges comparison of quantitive measures to qualitative values.\nInfrastructure Design\nLet’s frame the high level design abstractions we will lean on in relation to our ends: These could more sensibly be framed as:\n\nMarkov blankets act as a form of general substrate that can then be further systematised with metadata to enable semantic interoperability - this is a highly general medium that is analogus to merkle trees and hash graphs. In Regens case this technical infrastructure is represented by the data module.\nAn Impact certificate essentially articulates a given methodology in a machine readable format. These certificates represent a set of means, while evaluation criteria codified in a similar format can express values as ends. For example - when it comes to open science - there is a growing movement towards making papers more accessible by encoding them as ‘conversation graphs’; this might be represented in a tetradic geometry with nodes representing:\n\nExtrapolating such a concept one step further it’s easy enough to imagine a form of bespoke facilitation where the content of any conversation can be functionally represented as geometries to support the processes of communal understanding.\nWhen a discussion reaches consensus on credit class, methodology, DAO design, evaluation criteria etc. we can use the interface to easily store and anchor data on chain. Any subsequent dialogue can be self-managed by the community, easily updating their credit design parameters through their governance process through a simple interface. Supporting conversation and data can be aggregated as a form of composable capital to be issued as eco-credits which would democratise access to technology in a significant way. Such a process can even be turned into art or gamified to make the process fun and rewarding!\nBelow the interface level comes the functional specifications for on chain integration. Using the AD4M ontology we can integrate general systematics to describe a set of metadata standards. From there we can describe both the data module and eco-credit modules as ‘languages’ and ‘perspectives’ in order to make them interoperable with other systems architectures. For added precision, we may wish to add other ontological ‘perspectives’ for translating quantity (data module claims like MRV) to quality (eco-credit attestations like REA).\nIn the case of the latter Resource, Event, Agent accounting is a particularly useful ontology to integrate as its institutionally recognised accounting standard for distributed supply chains. This might then use feeds from Monitoring, Reporting and Verification technologies as evaluation criteria for impact certificates. The elegance of this design is that if these standards are changed or extended, they can be easily recomposed or updated.\nFor example we can extend the triadic geometry MRV to be a tetradic geometry for a more detailed resolution. The following was articulated by dMeter community members:\n\nUltimately whatever indicators are at desirable can be articulated through General Systematics and codified as Markov blankets to unlock the capabilities of semantically composable impact markets. These functional models can then be enriched with Active Inferencing to provide a more detailed depth of resolution.\nPilot Tokenomic Mechanism(s): Adaptive Capital\nThe architecture above is designed at the level of general infrastructure and can be used for composing any desirable credit design, which is dependent on the articulation of parametric groupings instantiated around a use case or pilot project. These paramaters and the rules governing them matter significantly when scaled to the level community, commons or bioregion.\nThere are already number of great projects in the Regen ecosystem that would stand to benefit from such composable designs and we’re keen to partner based on DAO capacity. LunarPunk Labs as proposal authors have a strong preference towards working closely with our existing partners at the charity Regenerating Sonora in order to build out a low risk pilot project. Conditions around them are exceptionally vital as they have LEHR gardens, a community centre with a blockchain learning desk and high school tech club working with Arudino sensors!\nBasic Credits: Regenerating Sonora use case\n\nCommunity Capital: H3 University use case\nAn example methodology our students might use to additionally codify the co-benefits produced by the communities vibrant social capital is the H3uni framework deployed on the current course “The art of creative collaboration”. This particular practice based methodology groups eight sets of parameters under four framing conditions.\nFraming conditions:\n\nParamater Groupings:\n\nThis particular methodology is currently being demonstrated as both the H3uni course with video documentary evidence AND is being discussed amongst our teams on WeCo.io as a ‘weave’ (chains of 1min audio recordings / 140 character cards in a sequence as a conversation graph). The data from this form of ‘prosocial-computation’ can all be anchored on a storage medium of choice using the Regen Data Module. You can keep up with the teams pretotype testing here.\nTeams as Viable Systems DAO\n\nPathways\n\nProject exposure\n\n—\nRoadmap and Budget\nMeta\n\nMilestone one: Functional Specifications\nStart Date: 2023-04-06 Deliverables:\n\nBudget:\n\nMilestone Two: Tokenomics DAO Design\nStart Date: 2023-07-17 Deliverables:\n\nBudget:\n\nMilestone Three: Pilot Project(s)\n\nBudget:\n\nMilestone Four: Tokenomics csDAO\nBudget:\n\nMilestone Five: Engineering\n\nBudget: TBD\nMilestone Six: Perfected Designs\n\nBudget: TBD\nMilestone Seven: Quality Control\n\nBudget: TBD\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/portfolio/calma/","title":"Calma Video","description":null,"body":"\n\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/portfolio/cursed/","title":"Cursed Animation","description":null,"body":"\n\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/portfolio/elephantsdream/","title":"Elephants Dream Animation","description":null,"body":"\n\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/portfolio/encaged/","title":"Encaged","description":null,"body":"\n\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/portfolio/neonfleacircus/","title":"Fistfull of I.O.U's","description":null,"body":"Neon Flea Circus · Fistful of IOUs","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/portfolio/lespaul/","title":"Les Paul","description":null,"body":"","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/portfolio/clubs/","title":"Lighting Design","description":null,"body":"\n\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/portfolio/projectplay/","title":"Project Play","description":null,"body":"JoshAFairhead · Sample","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/portfolio/saturator/","title":"Saturator","description":null,"body":"\n\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/portfolio/sonsofgingerbread/","title":"Sons of Gingerbread","description":null,"body":"Sons Of Gingerbread · Sons Of Gingerbread\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/travel/","title":"Travel","description":null,"body":"","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/travel/indiapt4/","title":"Auroville Evolution","description":null,"body":"\nSettled and stable once again in a reasonably priced hotel; I decide to head out for coffee in the international zone and see what trails there are to follow. Not wishing to miss the experience of transcending in the Matrimandir I set course towards the giant golden egg in hopes of finding a means to book such a visit.\nI begin by exploring the visitors centre and learn that Auroville was not built for it’s initial settlers but instead to inspire later generations of visitors. As I depart I stumble into a systematic cluster of parameters that are apparently the mothers symbol; a dodecad of archetypal qualities to flowers - woah!\n\nFollowing the trail further there are a number of tokens clearly left behind for adept scavengers like myself. I’m delighted to find this work as it ties into the material that I’ve been studying at h3uni.org and consequentially wonder if Aurobindo and Gurdjieff migh have ever crossed paths?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuing along the path I collect all twelve of the tokens above en route towards the giant cosmic egg. Just before my arrival at the viewing spot, I pause a moment to enjoy the sprawling Banyan tree; it’s gigantic and seems to have several other trees grafted into its extensive branches for both support and nourishment. I have to send Jimi this beauty so snap a picture!\n\nLooking out over the gardens from the viewing spot it dawns on me that Auroville is far from complete; even the gardens around matrimandir are still under construction as they are apparently still putting in the water works.\nA flashback of my time at Liminal Village in Italy arises where I helped Roberto with a grey water pool, though this is on another scale altogether! Sandro would have loved the diggers here for sure; he always had a hard-on for the big toys and these were a level up on the ones he was driving!\n\n\nI set off back down the road again with no idea where I’m headed, hedging along the outer perimeter before hitting the gate house. Maybe I can book a meditation here? I check in with the guards who say no and are utterly unhelpful about how to book so I message Laurence to find out how he managed to do so before continuing my hunt for the next serendipitous token.\nHmmm, I’ve been walking for a while and haven’t found much yet. I’m enjoying my jaunt but finding only a few curiosities despite the amusing street signs; I decide to visit Humbleness avenue before venturing into Prosperity as this seems like an appropriate order to proceed as one certainly doesn’t wanna do it the other way around… Besides some pretty flowers there’s are not many interesting curiosities so decide to trek back towards my initial point of departure at the visitors centre.\n\n\n\n\nThis leads me past by some rather aggressive dogs that come after my heels and need to be scared off by threatening them with a coconut while barking and growling back; they run when chased which I internalise as a life lesson.\nEn route back there are numerous colourful temples with pantheons of rainbow gods as well as some smouldering grey ones that look like portals to the underworld. Some beautiful mandalas round these parts too; Rangoli’s as tribute to Lakshmi (or as Rishi put it NFT’s to god)!\n\n\n\n\nBack at visitors centers I decide to plunder the information boards for hidden parameter clusters; the Aurovillians have done a good job with their systematic groupings - bravo you beauties - you’ve been preserving your esoteric transmission exceptionally well; though I’m still not sure exactly sure the magickal roots this place, it’s pretty enigmatic and the lineage feels legit! (Max Théon apparently).\nChecking Twitter out that evening I notice Joe Brewer’s emitted some warning signals related to the Regen Foundation after having been messed around and instrumentalised by them. Feeling a degree of accountability towards that unfolding I ask him if he minds sharing some of the details and after some initial reflection on these I recall the letter that arrived from chaosmos the day before within Jashs gift and decide it’s time to sink the boat by publicly sharing my own experience and testimony on Twitter - aye - what a dramatic universe!\nExpecting a bunch of vitriol in response I decide to turn off my phone and start Friday with some legitimate Vedic healing, which did not disappoint. The shaman had a collection of wooden chisels that he used to affect 144 points in the feet which I note as an interesting multiple of twelve… empirically speaking my energetics were notably effected from this therapy and I became unusually chatty for my pre-caffeinated state. I learnt the shaman made all his own medicine as well though I didn’t try them due to the relatively high cost.\nFeet in good shape (for once), I set off for morning coffee and to check the activity board. It really didn’t seem like there was much on bar some “power yoga” a couple of hours later so I decided to kill some time by walking out to the movement centre in order to give that a go. As it was my friends birthday a few days prior, I’d been trying to call through to wish him well and finally got through on the walk. He’d recently become a father and seemed pretty happy to be white picket fencing with his beautiful and caring wife Maddie.\nThe power yoga session certainly lived up to its name; starting slowly but quickly picking up pace to become exceptionally challenging (for me at least). The instructor noticed my struggles and reaffirmed the invitation to retreat into child pose whenever we felt necessary, which is something I was already doing whenever things got too tough for me. This is something that a friend experienced in Samkyha mentioned as a stumbling block on his journey so was only too happy to surrender when past my capacity. I thanked the instructor for a fantastic stretch and set out on my way; I felt a liveliness in my feet and my general ergonomics from the legs to chest were feeling pretty damn good at this point!\nSaturday I decide to entertain myself with some of challenges Laurence had implicitly set me up with earlier in the week; “Transcend in the Matramandir”, “grab some cookies from the Auroville bakery; choconut”, “Tantos has excellent food” etc. - and since Jash wanted to head in the rough direction got in the car with him and ticked the latter challenges off the list and sent back the evidence.\n\nJash is headed back to the hotel so drops me near the Svram research centre for musical instruments where I test out everything in store and then join a tour in the sound garden. The tour introduction has already started and as I’m paying for my ticket the larger than life host asks some rather metaphysical questions that I respond to with a cosmological quip that he enjoys (I can’t remember what).\n\nFrom here we break into groups with different guides and tour the garden; my guide seems quite the miser who’s just stating surface level information so I break off and investigate the toys on my own. This somewhat pisses him off as he gets rather upset once I happen upon the cymatic plates; he accuses me of disrespecting the instrument and ignorance of it, to which I demonstrate considerable knowledge otherwise and he kinda changes his tone. At this point I’ve played with the various instruments anyway so decide to leave the garden based on his unplayful vibe.\n\nAs I’ve also been mistakenly charged 10x the tours ticket price I return to the music store to get a refund and as I’m leaving bump into the host who actually turns out to be the store owner. He begins to engage me with Aurovillian metaphysical philosophy and we end up in a bit of a satsang together around the spiritualisation of matter and such. He’s delightfully entertaining and seems to be sharing some pretty advanced teachings and intuitions. Somewhere in the passing hours he informs me that I was brought to Auroville for a reason which seems both true and a truism!\nAs the sun begins to set I head back to the hotel to find Rishi and Jash in a design jam. They suggest a gig in the same area where I started the day and since Laurence already challenged me to grab a cheesecake in Aurojar cafe after recieving my previous messages the proposition appeals.\nI depart on foot to close out the loose end and send through both a proof and a request for less hedonistic challenges. He asks me if I ticked off the matrimandir, which I’ve booked for the final day before departure and awake at 7:30am for such a privilege.\n\nArriving to the visitors centre there’s a queue to the auditorium where one is informed of Aurovilles history and symbology. We then jump into a bus to the cosmic egg and are permitted entry into the gardens once we’ve turned in our phones and electronic devices. From here we are led into the Matrimandir in a ritualistic fashion, replacing shoes with white socks and then following a spiral catwalk from the ground floor to the meditation chamber.\n\nIn here, a beam of light enters through a hole in the roof channelling the sun into the largest contact ball I’ve ever seen; at 70cm its apparently the largest perfect glass sphere in the world… This is supposedly symbolic of concentration in that it focuses the light downward into the marble lilly pond several floors below. Holding it’s weight are several hexads stuck together that are supposedly Aurobindos symbol, though more widely known as Solomons seal or the star of David.\nThe chamber has round walls so it’s an (intentional?) acoustics nightmare; every tiny sound carries and coughs reverberate loudly! There is little to no silence in the room; despite it being mandated. I wonder if this is all an elaborate joke referencing our inability for stillness?\nAfter leaving the inner sanctum we are left to investigate the grounds and invited to meditate in one of the twelve energy centres of our own choosing (based on the mothers symbol above). These little enclaves were kinda cool with their coloured lighting and funky shapes on the wall; nothing too special but would make cool saunas - which is what the one I visited was due to lack of air conditioning!\nThe marble lilly pond below was also kinda cool, though I honestly got culty swimming pool vibes from the whole place. It’s a decent spectacle but frankly it felt pretty plastic and material - which they are assumedly trying to spiritualise! I found it all to be quite interesting magick none the less; especially the geometric symbols at each entrance. What’s the messaging here? And what’s the meaning?\n\n\nThe platonic solids in tetradic petals huh…\n\nHaving started the tour inside the centre of the cosmic egg, we are freed to check out the truly beautiful gardens. Similar to the mothers symbol there are twelve petals around the egg that each representing a different cosmic quality. Only four of the twelve gardens were complete; though several others were under construction. Here’s a photo from the Auroville website.\n\nDeparture\nFinishing up here I return to the hotel to say goodbye to Rishi and Jash before hopping into a cab to the airport. It turns out my first flight is delayed, which scuppers my exit. I’m told that I can get a refund for this and grab an alternative ticket to Mumbai for $30~ which I take.\nChecking in for a flight to Vietnam I’m asked if for a covid test; whoops, nope forgot about that… Vaccination, nope. “Where can I get one?”. “Outside” says the checkin agent and takes me towards the exit. She asks the security where it is and they say its closed down. Crap. I decide to google an answer and make a dash for it given my limited time. The first recommendation is non existent so I google an alternative and try jumping in a cab. The driver points out that there is a test centre just over by the entrance and there actually is… aye, thank god for this guy!\nI ask for two tests the immediate one and the one 48 hour test I need to give the check-in desk for Vietnam. The lady here is cool with that but doesn’t have a card reader, she let’s me take the tests before running inside with all my bags in search of an ATM. Literally all the ATM’s in the airport however are outta cash or not working so I ask an American tourist if he’d be able to help me out.\nHe kindly agrees and I give him the spare change I have for his larger denomination bill before bringing it back to the PCR lady only to find out I’ve given him too much change! Since I’m only a little short however she agrees to let it slide.\nExhausted from running around with my bags and several kilos of books I finally make it to the check-in desk to and the celebratory fanfare of agents who didn’t think I was gonna make it. They give me extra leg room seats and I head to boarding.\n💎 Good bye India, you’re a precious jewel! 💎\n\nBefore we depart here’s a selection of Rangoli and other tokens found on my Easter egg hunt around Auroville that don’t quite fit anywhere else!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/travel/indiapt3/","title":"Auroville Involoution","description":null,"body":"\nMonday we say good bye to the folks round Atlantis HQ and after some lunch we set off for Auroville with the unexpected addition of Treegens Jimi, adding some welcome dynamism to the party of myself and Rishi.\n\nStopping at various points en route to enable Jimi to host various twitter spaces we exchange tunes and banter while beelining our way towards a hotel just outside Auroville. Were trying to make a 9pm zoom slot that requires a computer and due to a fucked laptop screen hes hoping for a place with a TV.\nIt’s pretty tight but we make it; no spare screen though so I give him my computer for the call and enjoy his radiant energy and love for treeeeeees from two floors up; I’m frankly laughing my ass off as I consider the porters perspective of this spectacle because Jimi’s in the lobby positioned about 2 ft from the front desk and emphatically onboarding folks for an attempt at the Guinness world record. This would probably be a bit annoying if it were for some less quirky cause but since it’s for most trees planted in a day it’s probably quite resonant with the Aurovillian ethos!\n\nEntering the international zone\nIn the morning we pack up our stuff and head for coffee in the visitors centre thates only a few minuites walk away the international zone. As I’m checking out the information boards Rishi signals my attention to say that he belives he just spotted a rather mysterious acquaintance of ours called Manoj; a mystic that once graced an equinox gathering we organised in 2020!\nAs if to confirm the intuition, my phone unexpectedly started playing some Gurdjieff DeHartmann tunes and we make haste to say hello to our suspect. Indeed it is Manoj; he’s moving extremely slowly as if carrying a lot of mental weight. As we depart from the interaction I let the friend who introduced us know - who it turns out had just been on an ayahuasca journey the night before and had synchronistically seen Manoj (or someone that looked like him) within his visions.\n\nAs we depart, Jimi books us all places at the “BonGipsy eco-hut stay” a hippie haunt that costs about a fiver each. On first appearances its a pretty interesting environment but something’s up; I feel a heeeeeavy drag of tamas energy. Damn; this place is an energetic black hole… we struggle to even drive out the gates due to unhelpful helpers engaging the lads and distracting them at every turn and I begin to feel like I’m in a zombie movie.\nAs we stop at the beach I realise just how agitated I am from the experience and tell the lads there’s no way in hell I’m staying there so we move into the Unearth Hostel for a night. It’s a nicer spot, and also ran by complete stoners - though this time helpfully unhelpful folk that are quite independent and not looking to feed on the brains of their new arrivals.\nWishing to book a meditation in the Matrimandir, myself and Jimi head off to look for the famous golden egg. Instead we end up rather lost and while checking google maps for directions a seemingly friendly bull decides to headbutt Jimi. A couple of passing girls laugh at this ask if were lost, like I mean no shit, but it turns out that they are in a similar position and looking for a sound healing session. As this sounds better than searching out a booking office that’s probably closed, we decide to join them instead for this excursion instead. Turns out to be a good choice.\n\nYeah, we’re lost.\nUpon arrival we’re invited to lie down comfortably, close our eyes and just let ourselves to be. If movement surfaces in our bodies, just honour it gently. It’s a stereoscopic spree of polyphonic harmonics; instruments of all varieties played in the full sound scape of the auditorium. Real life surround sound. As I allowed my consciousness to drift around the various elements, I sensed a number of crystalline brain structures dissolving in the layer cake of neutral semantic energy, evaporating from my body in the form of tears. More lachromony, this time of a subtle variety.\nReturning back to the Unearth Hotel we’re recommended a nearby cafe for food where we can have dinner, make use of the internet and take various calls. An old peer calls me out of the blue; he’s now hacking banks as a white hat and serendipitously wishes to hook me up with a cryptographer friend that’s been training him in.\nYes please mate, that sounds great - though I’m a little concerned he’s now hacking banks… I’m pleased to hear that he’s finally got comfortable employment that suits him well as a white hat; though such a skill set could be a double edged sword as he could very easily end up as public enemy number one if he happens into hard times again… he’s grown up on the worst estate of the UK monopoly board and is consequentially unfused about the moralities of normative society; perfect red team material as white hat - hopefully it goes well and lasts!\nRishi sends me some stuff that the NAO folks are doing on “Greencheck” identity; really cool way of doing sibyl proof humanity. Framed in the context of previous work a picture really starts to paint itself. Brad also seems to recognise the overlaps and enthusiastic to do some work together; I guess I’ll have to write up a synthesis of all this identity stuff at some point soon. In the meanwhile we send each other various pieces of work and notes.\nJash, an old friend of Rishis, arrives in the evening and gifts me a creative artefact they both worked on that’s truly exxxxceeelllent!! Like a sign from the chaosmos its a synchronicity that’s far too weird to be causal in any linear or causal way; there’s a letter enclosed that seems to pertain to my time at the Regen Foundation suggesting that my hesitancy in action has completely sunken a boat… yes; this is a rather schizoid association to make but seriously WTF!!? It just gets weirder everyday…\n\n\nIt just gets weirder everyday…\nThanks for descending this far, yeah - we are now in the belly of the beast so you might consider checking out the next part of the story for upward momentum and resolve as it’s the best part of the Auroville journey!\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/travel/indiapt2/","title":"Bangalore","description":null,"body":"\nWith no plans laid out post Green Pill Festival; myself and Rishi drove overnight to Bangalore in order to get his new lady friend Aaba to hospital and back home.\nThe most likely scenario was that she had a stomach bug from nibbling on a kiwi fruit that was in turn nibbled on by a rat; while speculative, this situation seems pretty plausible given there were apparently two other run-ins with rodents that evening while we were on the road down…\nJimi ended up needing rabies shots due to a bite on his finger; while Marco awoke up to something fuzzy on his leg which he promptly kicked into the roof making an audibly large thud - as there was no body was identified it seems likely a rodent who somehow survived the impact. Ouch.\n\nBesides these events, all parties made it to Bangalore good spirits and met up for coffee after a good nights rest. Sino, Marco, Rishi, Jimi and myself met with Jacob and his lovely co-founder to learn about local design, indigenous crafts and supply chains before geeking out on blockchain economics. By and large this discussion was a demonstrative means to confer the value of diagrammatic reasoning and conversation graphs.\nAfter a Thursdays internetting with Rishi and Sino we decide to try and visit a temple together. Departing the coffee shop I receive a message from Jacob saying he’s interested in the excursion and walking towards us from his part of town. Detouring to pick him up at a restaurant we discover that the clock has already struck midnight and the temple is closing imminently. Cest la vie.\n“New plan; let’s head to Atlantis HQ and grab Marco”. Pinging him and others about our vector we receive no response and head over anyway only to discover that no one’s in. “Oh yeah they’re probably out for dinner with Sudebi and Probal”… “How do you guys feel about an escape room?” proposes Jacob, who’s suggestion passes almost instantly.\nOhhohoho, another portal summoning the forces of charoder! Myself, Rishi, Jacob and Sino make a pretty awesome team as we naturally fall into appropriate roles. The high stimulus environment of blaring white noise and strobe lights has Sino pretty agitated though… and I’m handcuffed to his side!\nWithin minutes, Rishi and Jacob are completely free of their chains and we get to work on a perspex puzzle that turns off the white noise generator; sweet relief! Its rather odd to still have the strobe light going but we get that off too; immediately Sino spots a key hanginging rather inconspicously by the speaker and were through the shutters into the next room.\nWhat were all those number-plates about then? no bloody idea, I drop it and start to stare at a poster full of guns with code names and try to find a pattern as others work on a cryptic flow chart that opens up the next door… A shelf, items, some math on the back of a door and a computer…. “okay, what are we supposed to do with these?” I wonder.\nOh ok, the computer requires a password and that seems to be a code associated with one of the guns I was looking at. The lads are about to crack the shelving puzzle which determines the reference code for the gun.\nGot it, its AK3080 (or something). A song with gun shots… ok, count them? right - yeah that’s the next door code. Home straight indeed now lads; what’s this map of India all about? Yeah the string goes round all these posts for some reason… but which ones and why? Ohhh, back to the number plates at the beginning for the layouts…\nYES Sino! Spot on, your right, it looks exactly like the symbol on all the props; what an interesting hermeneutic reference! X marks the spot so the Bangalore number plate is the final code? Clank, yup, we’re outta here! Drinks?\n\nFriday we’re invited to Utkarsh’s place in the evening so we call in a little early to do some co-working in with him and his friend Scooby. This takes us into a discussion on $Earthcoin, its tokenomics and general mechanism design. Jimi, working on a proposal in the other room periodically buzzes in and out to test his thinking and from there the conversation turns to bonding curves and liquidity pools.\nAs we put the white board away a number of the Green Pill Festie folk start to show up at the house along with their various partners and girlfriends. The party’s a little fragmented but also relatively civil given there were freeskates and slacklines available to cause accidents! Ever the dry shite, I head home at about 1am to get some rest.\n\n\nSaturday is April 1st and as usual I’m playing the fool; having toured the design school and beautiful market with Marko and Sino during the first half of the day I attempt to make it over to a Polkadot event which is supposedly happening in the Sheraton hotel; I just happen to go to the wrong one… With the correct address an hour across town it seems the event will close by the time I arrive; I subsequently admit defeet (gettit?) and decide to look for shoes around the nearby shopping mall.\nBump! - “Oh hello Sino,, fancy seeing you again haha! Marcos in Starbucks? Ok, cool - I’ll drop in for a moment to say hi. Hola mate, me again; get anything done? yeah I’ll try a sweet, what are they? mmm they’re are a little bitter sweet just like my day haha! Right, you guys are gonna do some shopping? I’ll stay here for some coffee and writing. See you back here in an hour or so.”\nAfter an reasonably extensive writing session I wonder where they disappeared to, check a group chat and discover movement being planned across town… “Ok yeah, I’ll head over to the restaurant club thing you lot are meeting at”.\nJumping in a rickshaw I ask the price. The driver says 2000 rupee; so I say forget it and begin to get out as it cost me 400 to get over so I figure it should be about the same back. The driver begins to haggle with me and we settle on 500. A few minutes later a change of venue comes in over the telegram and coordinates are actually closer, so I update the driver and he’s good with it - or so I believe. As we arrive at my destination he tries charge 2000 again…\nWe go back and forward on this as he’s intent on getting whatever he can and I’m intent on a reasonable and fair outcome. He tries a number of approaches including shame and anger, calling me a cheater and so forth which is all rather unpleasant so I give him the 5oo and angrily point to a cop car to settle things. His tone changes to panicked and rather weak so I give him another 100 to close the matter in sympathy.\nGuru and Utkarsh arrive after a short wait in the restaurant, who upon hearing about my kerfuffle laugh and suggest that “it shoulda been 200 dude - book through Uber, the drivers always try to rip us off too!”.\nA number of others begin to arrive in convoy now but as Marcos in shorts the venue refuses him entry so we decide to leave. Jimi has already hit the dance floor so we grab him and get into Utkarsh’s car and set off for a more local social club they frequent.\nAs we pull out of the car park we pass the others and suddenly drivers start to changing, people are rotating in and out of the car as logistics are figured out and after a little bit of turbulence and we’re on our way again. Dubstep on the radio, we somehow pass the others in a rickshaw… and then promptly leave them for dust.\nAs we arrive, I reflect on the novelty of dropping the car off to the valet; a privilege I’ve never experienced before - probably because I’ve never had my own wheels or the cash to rent a car while visiting foreign countries - so it feels a bit like entering a James Bond casino in an odd kinda way.\nEntry fee covers drinks and being a dry shite I don’t need them so Guru kindly pays my entry and redistributes the tokens; the place is pretty dope place. Way less flashy than the place we left in order to get here but more fun and quirky; it’s layout actually reminds me of a night club I used to tech manage.\nAfter about an hour the others travelling by rickshaw arrive just in time to get booted out for close. Myself and Rishi were gonna stay with Irthu but feeling pretty tired I wish them all a good night and set off to find myself a hotel as they move on to party. Finding a spot is less easy than expected but after checking a few non existent locations on google maps I stumble across the same hotel I checked out of in the morning in order to complete a perfect circle!\n\nSunday is pretty graceful; I grab a coffee at my regular spot ‘talk over table’ and then head over to visit Irthu. Something really starts to light up as we jam on cosmology and myths of creation and after a while he asks me what LunarPunk Labs is doing…\nAvoiding transcendental narratives to explain the mystery I’m swimming through I suggest ‘what’ is the wrong question as it’s generated from the ‘how’. He beams at this answer and recommends a book called ‘draw to win’ - oh yeah that lands.\nScrawling all over the desk he begins to share the Atlantean vision and his backstory of working with Mercy Corp. Holy fuck - he’s actually been there and totally legit; they were solving issues around the Indian water supply for years and actually got pretty far before pissing off some mafiosa, which forced them to close their company for safety reasons. Decentralisation was a means of moving forward while spreading the risk.\nThe vision and narrative vibed for me but ever the pragmatist their crew history impressed me most; they’d been practising various forms of solidarity while co-living and getting their hands dirty. Irthu shared a number of designs patterns informed from their experience and the ontology was pretty tight. Super general and useable across numerous projects.\n\nAs a disassociated technologist I’ve been going pretty meta to avoid opinionation while working at a functional level in my own designs as those closest to the problem are best suited to solve it. Ever hesitant to prescribe a particular ontology for this reason I’m glad to finally stumble into a set of opinions that actually count for something rather than some Refi marketing hype espoused by innocent fools who by and large have become brainwashed instruments of the ‘network state’.\nDiscussion continues into all kinds of subject matter often considered taboo or woowoo and my flame begins to burn brighter. Irthu has rather interesting edge that’s as explorative as my own and is just as sceptical. Seems we both love to run pattern analysis on novel perspectives when they come from a place of curiosity rather than ideology (too blackpilled to eat more of that!).\n\nThere’s a healthy scepticism present in our convo but were also faaaar off piste into the free field of potentiality; ahh sweet refreshment. This is the type of interaction where the impossible suddenly seems to become possible; balanced flow in a far from equilibrium states… cause, choice, change!\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/travel/indiapt1/","title":"Gorkana","description":null,"body":"\nOver the precipice once again; searching for god knows what I jump a flight to Atlantis… I mean to Gokarna to meet Rishi in person for the first time; despite having shared a lot of time together online during the COVID period.\nHe’d met the Atlantis team at Refi Bangalore who were convening a gathering called “green pill festival”; a retreat for founders and hackathon builders. We stayed here for a week hanging out with their crew while workshopping our way forward into the unknown.\n\nArriving after 26 hours of travel I crashed out twice, only to awake at 4am in a jet lagged delirium before going for for a walk in the darkness to shake the fog. The atmospheres mysterious and electric, with chants vibrating through the air from across a nearby field. I attempt a search out the noise but am unable to locate the source so decide to vocalise in resonance instead while setting out for a walk across the beach. Suddenly there’s scuttling all round my feet; zippity clacky clack ziiiiiiiip - what the hell are these funky creatures? They’re fast as lightning and under the darkness of new moon it’s impossible to discern.\nFollowing another cycle of rest, I’m woken from a knock at my door; answering in my underwear I’m briefly introduced to an unexpected room mate that I’ll be sharing space with who’s name is Raj. “Come on in man, get yourself sorted - about time I got up anyway”. Another knock, this time Kieran from the Atlantis team. “Do you wanna do some yoga?” he asks, “Great timing, yeah, that’s just what I was thinking about” - “Ok then, its happening in ten minutes over on the beach!”\nAt this stage I’m feeling pretty much recovered from all the sleep and exercise and now realise what the night scuttlers were; crabs coming out of their burrows under cover of the new moon during low tide. As we do sun salutations on the sand a number of jokes are cracked about them emerging only to bite asses.\nOn my way back to shower, I cross paths with Guru who’s a little concerned about the retreats programming and facilitation so offer a hand. We sit down to sequence and embellish the workshops he’s put together and I’m thoroughly impressed by the containers developed based on Wilburs integral theory (essentially a western appropriation of Aurobindos work). As it turns out, I’ve little to contribute to the programme other than a few loose ideas as the workshops are set and well sequenced; the best I can offer is some reassurance in hopes of relieving pressure.\nUtkarsh tangentially joins us at the table and we talk about the contextual realities surrounding regeneration and the forces that need to be confronted. It’s refreshing to have a break from narratives as we dive into market jujitsu; he really gets this and over the rest of the week the two of us share a number of discussions; feet in the water we discuss cosmology, markets, science, technology, ideology and spirituality.\n\nWithout needing to say anything much there’s a lot of resonance; our discussions are essentially pleasant verbalisations due to the novel sense of complementarity. We share and learn. One particular gem he informs me of is that the Vedics leveraged their precise cosmology to record historical events against planetary movements as a means of verification; more cosmological logistics!\nAs the weeks workshops play out the facilitators hold space well despite our open environment presenting distractions like the nearby juice stall. We dive into communication practices with Jacob from Terregeneration; a gentle soul who spent several years of his life cleaning up a mountain he and his partner moved to. As attention wanes with the approaching sunset other facilitator types like Didi step in to heard the cats and keep the timings on course.\n\nAs the light begins to fade with sunset over sea I spend a bit of time juggling which opens up a conversation with Jacob. In the meanwhile, Utkarsh playfully steals a stray ball and disappears with it probably believing his actions have gone unnoticed which leaves Jacob mildly nonplussed, informing me that “someone” has taken the prop. As our conversation winds down Utkarsh appears from the darknesse to reveal himself as the thief and return it as a fellow agent of balanced chaorder!\nThe final workshop is pure gold. It’s a role playing game called “its just business” which leads to outright chaos. Participants are enrolled into a ficticious scenario regarding a fictional island and asked to inhabit roles within this multi-stakeholder ecosystem; there’s an international airline looking to capitalise on tourism, the local government, fishermen, conservationists, youth, elders and such.\nAs we go about negotiations with eachother the occasional news flash is broadcast regarding the state of international affairs - which in turn changes the political dynamics. After the negotiation stage we return to a plenary session in order to articulate each groups positions to the government, who makes a final call on what’s to happen while simultaneously trying to stay in power by appeasing all parties.\nOhhohoho man, this is when things got as fragmented as the house of commons during Brexit; there was tons of booing, hissing and an almighty racket as the various factions fought over their values. It was brutal and many of the representatives were genuinely rattled by the uproar and froze. The youth were particularly disruptive having made an alliance with the airlines (who having dismissed the fishermen had “we’ve got boats” repeatedly chanted at them - yes guilty, that was me)…\nFinally the government made their decision to allow the airport and were unanimously voted out of power - even by the airlines - who as it turns out, had embraced corruption by impersonating the government in order to achieve their ends! What a bloody mess… but thankfully only a simulation! You can’t win them all.\nThe ‘business’ consortium\n\nSunday is our day in Gorkana and a few special guests are passing through to see whats happening.

The first principals he surfaced are foundational to a number of related theories like spiral dynamics and integrates many others. If your interested in the field you should probably start here before looking at other work as its one of the more robust and reliable.\n\nIntroduction\nThis article basically acts as an exposition to highlight my investigations into the work of Clare Graves, a New York psychology professor who brought the world an evidence based meta-model known as Emergent Cyclical Theory.\nHis work is salient to me due to its broad utility and explanatory power that’s capable of integrating a plethora of existing theories as well as clarifying a lot of confusion around various existential questions; in a nutshell it’s a great lens to lean on when making sense of the world!\nFor many of us society can seem rife with fragmentation and contradictory views due to our heterogeneous and pluralistic nature. Gazing through this kaleidoscope of world views it’s hard not to get lost in the fractal and such chaorder can feel extremely unpredictable, arbitrary and uncertain at times.\nThis artefact thus originates from a personal desire to discern order from chaos. Are there constants in the complexity of values that drive human behaviour? my own conjecture here is basically yes but that discussion is out of scope. For now we are going to look at vertical integration and skip out on the horizontal axis.\nGraves’ work is grounded in inquiry rather than hypothesis and highlights the importance of an unfolding evolutionary process rather than the static models and prescriptions often found in other psychological literature. Many of these theories do indeed contain grains of truth but let us momentarily pause here to note that there many castles made out of sand. There is no one ring to rule them all.\nI’ll endeavour not to mislead you but please note that I’m what you might call an epistemic trespasser in the waters of psychology so please engage your critical faculties and do your best to remember that “the map is not the territory!”\nFirstly, I’m gonna prime you with some asides on the theory and then lead you through it’s history and background. After that, I’ll get down and dirty with the framework and detail some of the research Graves explicated. Then we’ll discuss the underlying process which drives the model and I’ll add some reflections regarding its significance and potential use. Last, I’ll add some of my own experiences and some commentary before concluding the essay. Enjoy!\nAn Essential Open Inquiry\nEMT came perilously close to remaining a buried treasure when Graves witnessed his friend and colleague Abraham Maslow unceremoniously “torn to pieces” by colleagues at an APA seminar in the mid 1950’s. He subsequently vowed to never put himself into a similar situation until he could adequately defend his own position; a rather difficult task that ultimately led him to obscurity rather than fame. Credit to him, he was rigorous and did the work.\nMuch of this work was later abandoned out of frustration and the book he was working on remained unpublished until after his death. Only later was it posthumously pieced back together again by peers and archivists digging through his remaining articles, transcripts and seminars.\nFor me, one of the most salient parts of this theory is that it considers the human condition as open-ended with no final state of enlightenment, self-actualization or nirvana. These states may indeed exist but the evidence seems to favour an endless search for order in a chaotic universe without an ultimate finality.\nEventually the more famous Abraham Maslow embraced Graves’ open-ended view despite many common interpretations of his work:\n\nYou should know that Maslow came around to my point of view. If you look at his later writings you will see that he accepted both the cyclic idea that there is more than one kind of expressive system and more than one kind of belonging system, and the system is open ended. We finally, after fighting this over for eight years, came to a fundamental agreement along that line. - Graves (Lee, 2002,  p. 52)\n\nThe essence of Graves’ work is that humans develop new bio-psycho-social coping mechanisms to deal with existential problems, and these emergent coping mechanisms arise in response to an increasingly complex environment. As the tide of human progress rises exponentially, it may be that we’ll begin to encounter more so called Buddhas about. Or face existential ruin…\n⚠️ For those who have already done a degree of reading around Spiral Dynamics, or Ken Wilbur etc, please do your best NOT to draw comparisons just yet. These works are all indeed very similar and also related but I’m deliberately avoiding discussion on these authors because they draw FROM this foundational work and conflating them may lead to confusion ⚠️\nHistory\nIn the early 1950’s Graves held a position as a psychology professor at Union College NY where a student of his posited the following question: from all the competing psychological theorists, whose model was ultimately correct?\nWith no immediate answer to hand, and a monkey on his back, Graves could only start collecting the data required to find out!\nHe began with the following lines of inquiry:\n\nCan one provide evidence that conflict and contradiction, confusion and controversy are represented in conceptions of psychological health?\nWhat are the conceptions of psychological health existing in the minds of biologically mature human beings?\nDo the concepts which exist suggest that psychological health should be viewed:\n\n(a) as a state or condition, or\n(b) as a psychological process?\n\n\nWhat is the essential nature of psychological health if it is a state or condition?\nWhat is the nature of the process of psychological health if the basic research indicates that it should be viewed thus?\n\nThese drivers were then further expanded into research questions in order to generate relevant data:\n\nHow do biologically mature human beings conceive of ‘what is the healthy personality’?\nDo biologically mature humans have, basically, one major identifiable conception of what the psychologically healthy adult is?\nDo biologically mature humans have more than one conception of what a healthy personality is?\nIf adults have several conceptions of healthy personality, are the conceptions classifiable into groups of similar conceptions?\nIf the various conceptions are classifiable, how can they be classified?\n\n\n(a) by content?\n(b) structurally?\n(c) functionally?\n\n\nWill there be evidence that a singular conception of healthy personality stands out as superior to other conceptions?\n\nThe primary issue surmised:\nWhat will be the nature and character of conceptions of psychological health of biologically mature human beings who are intelligent, but relatively unsophisticated in psychological knowledge in general, and in personality theory in particular?\nWith these formulations, Graves set out to conduct his research which unfolded in approximately four phases: Data Collection, Classification, Observation and Interpretation.\nPhase 1: Primary Data Collection\nAt the beginning of Graves’ investigation he was working in three schools (note three levels of recursion); one all male, another all female and the last was a mixed adult extension division. Over the course of his research he studied a relatively diverse group of about 1,065 subjects aged 18-61.\nHe needed ‘representative’ subjects for the purposes of his study; which he found in his relatively unsophisticated first year students that were enrolled on his “Theory of Normal Psychology” program. The classroom became a laboratory where he taught in ‘novel’ ways to accommodate his study while applying his methodology to eight sets of students, eight seperate times in order to generate his primary data set.\nUpon starting his lectures, he told his students not to read a single thing on psychology for the first five classes. The time was to be spent discussing what one might put into a conception of healthy personality and a personal conception was to be presented in a paper at the end of the first five weeks.\nIn the second set of five weeks, students were split into random groups and instructed to present their personal conceptions to peers and receive criticism. Graves observed their reactions and behaviours as their peers “went after them” with critique of their espoused conception.\nAt the end of the second interval of five weeks, students were asked to write up a defence or modification of their existing conception. This gave Graves a chance to observe if and how conceptions changed under peer influence.\nIn a third and final interval of five weeks, the class studied a variety of authorities and again turned in a modification of their original hypotheses. Graves then sat with randomly selected students to interview them about the process itself; how might their conceptions have changed and what were the factors that influenced them in changing their minds?\nThis data set produced:\n\nA large set of beliefs around the conception of a healthy psychology.\nReactions to the criticism of espoused beliefs, evidenced in observation and through paper defence and/or modification.\nRelation to confrontation with authority as evidenced through paper defence or modification.\nInterview data on the process of the primary experience.\n\nThrough this study, a second set of research questions opened up:\n\nWhat will happen to a person’s characterization of mature human behaviour when s/he is confronted with the criticism of his/her point of view by peers who have also developed their own conception of psychologically mature behaviour?\nWhat will happen to a person’s conception of mature human behaviour when confronted with the task of comparing and contrasting his/her conception of psychologically mature human personality to those conceptions which have been developed by authorities in the field?\nHow will the subjects behave under peer criticism?\n\nPhase 2: Classification\n⚠️ Note: Graves later reversed his lettering format; the first letter is for conditions, second for neurology ⚠️\nDiscernment and Differentiation\nYear after year an external panel of judges were instructed to classify the data into categories. This process was then blindly repeated by a second panel of judges - as per good science.\nThe data points repeatedly collapsed into two primary categories:\n\nExpress self; primarily motivated by internal forces.\nDeny self; predominantly driven by external forces.\n\nAs these two categories emerged each year (unknown to the panel) the research turned into a process of accumulation. Over 8 years, sub-categories also began to emerge in about 60% of the data. This data was later augmented and interpreted through further research in phase four of Graves’ inquiry.\nThe primary categories, the labels of which will be expanded on later, and the basic traits of the participants’ conceptions are as follows:\n\nDeny self:\n\n\na) sacrificially - Aka [BO].\nb) for deferred reward - Aka [DQ].\nc) for acceptance now - Aka [FS].\n\n\nExpress self:\n\n\na) as self desires in a calculating fashion, at the expense of others - Aka [ER].\nb) as self desires but not at the expense of others - Aka [GT].\n\nPhase 3: Observation of Interactions\nWith formalised classifications, Graves was now able to study his accumulated data and observations in depth. This was probably the most interesting phase of his study as it would reveal a good deal of information about how different conceptions tend to interact in the social field. It’s also where the situation began to turn into a somewhat more complex puzzle!\n\nThe first task was to study the formalised conceptions in relation to peer criticism as evaluated through a defence/modification of the conceptions espoused by a given subject - whether and how peer criticism influenced a subjects conception and the interaction patterns at play with peers in this process.\nThe second task was to study the formalised conceptions in relation to authoritative criticism as evaluated through a defence/modification of a subjects articulated conceptions - whether and how authoritative criticism influenced a subjects conception and the interaction patterns at play with authority in this process.\n\nBy diving into these fundemental interaction patterns the models of each conception were significantly enriched aiding the ongoing discernment process outlined in phase 2; why did it seem that there were such radical differences in the same “primary conceptions”?\nAs a quick revision, the similarities in the primary conceptions were:\n\nSacrificial conceptions were responsive to external conditions. They saw denial of self and degrees of conformity as the answer to their existential conditions.\nExpressive conceptions were NOT responsive to external conditions. They saw self expression as a means to overcome their existential conditions but would move into deny-self modalities when “central change” (movement to other modalities) occurred.\n\nThe subject of importance here was the difference between subjects occupying similar conceptions, particularly for enumerating and enhancing resolution on the subcategories. These findings are summarised below.\nDifferences between sacrificial conceptions:\nSome of the deny-self conceptions were dissimilar in relation to their effective change force. Certain subjects (the [DQ] conception) would respond only to an accepted higher authority and NOT their peers, remaining rigid and otherwise defending their initial conceptions to the last. Others however (the [FS] conception) would respond only to peer authority and NOT a perceived higher power. The two classifications were also quite dissimilar in terms of their perceived behavioural freedoms.\nDifferences between expressive conceptions:\nThe express-self conceptions were also quite different in terms of effective change forces. A number of subjects (the [ER] conceptions) would change only through self procured sources, while others (the [GT] conceptions) seemed to respond regardless of where a thought or information originated from.\nThese conceptions were also dissimilar in terms of perceived behavioural freedoms. Certain subjects (the [ER] conceptions) “always expressed themselves as if tethers were on them, always tying them down”, while others (the [GT] conception) didn’t feel bound to anything much at all - especially the goals of others. These subjects were generally non-argumentative but would often interject about perceived mistakes.\nGroup Work:\nWith increased resolution on the subcategories; students with the same conceptions of psychological maturity were grouped into classes and tasked with a specific problem. These subjects were then left to autonomously form groups and students with a…\n• [DQ] conception split up into small feudalistic units, each with separate leaders.\n• [ER] conception had a huge argument, with one eventual leader emerging.\n• [FS] conception worked well on their own without a leader.\n• [GT] conception chose the most appropriate leader for the task at hand and later to drop them for someone better suited for the next task.\nPhase 4: Outliers and Interpretation\nThe last phase was spent interpreting the data through research and factoring in world views from other non-industrialised cultures. These walks of life were were probably factored in to avoid immediacy bias.\nAround this time a new category also started to emerge as up until this point the available data seemed to point towards a final stage of psychological maturity… but a number of people with the ‘express self but without cost to the others’ conception began to reject their previous world views! This contradiction shook Graves’ work at its foundations and for a short time caused him a great deal of confusion.\nAfter the occurrence of these anomalies, people from working classes also began to gain access to higher education and it became evident that an earlier sub-category had been missed out; a remorseless ‘express self at all costs’ modality whom appeared to hold a ‘law of the jungle’ mentality where ‘might is right’.\nThis remorseless [CP] conception was thus the most primordial Graves collected in his primary sample, though as mentioned prior stages of cognitive evolution were later uncovered through anthropological research.\nThe subjects of this [CP] conception (‘express self mercilessly at all costs’) began to shift in their beliefs, lo and behold, into the already documented conception of ‘deny self for later reward’!\nThus in one stroke the earlier anomaly of [GT] subjects denying their own prior conceptions was also resolved; they had undergone a process of central change and were starting to embrace a yet inconceived modality. Subsequently, these findings paved the way for psychological health to be viewed as a process rather than fixed state.\nThis new category [HU] was as far Graves’ primary data went but he and a number of others believed that it wasn’t the end of the journey! Given how old this research is already paired with the rising complexity of our environment, we may now once again be witnessing the birth of a new conception not listed on the 1974 chart above; the [IV] modality. Graves speculated the progression was a ‘six on six ladder’ or octave – so keep an eye out!\nThe Dialectical Ladder\nSo far we’ve just reviewed the history of the research and how the conceptions were formed. At this point we can now begin to cover the topic more generally while trying to elicit some insights. The classifications are probably still a bit unclear so let’s quickly cover those in more depth.\nThe first set of characters in Graves’ notation system [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H] refer to “existential conditions’’ or the environment in which we inhabit. While the second set of characters [N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U] refer to what Graves termed “emergent coping mechanisms” – the capabilities we leverage to transcend our environments.\nThese emergent cycles might be thought of as a swinging pendulum where we oscillate between express-self and deny-self modalities in an unfolding process. What I find particularly interesting about the implications of Graves classifications is the generative dialectic between environment and organism.\nTo me, this dialectic feels like the difference between aspiration and embodied action; the environmental context gives rise to a set of needs or desires, which are then slowly manifested through a form of abductive reasoning embodied in new and novel behaviours. Like an octopus:\n\nGraves later revised the [GT] and [HU] conceptions to [AN’] and [BO’] as he theorised a ‘six on six ladder’. He did so because these later conceptions closely resembled the earliest stages with a post-subsistance twist.\nIn contrast to the Gravesian symbol system of letter pairings; the colours, categories and “value-memes” typically reified in Spiral Dynamics and related materials seem to grossly overlook this generative interplay, reducing it into a static typing system – something that I personally find unhelpful. This focus on static categories is a reductive fallacy that has often been used to claim higher ground and author legitimacy narratives. In my opinion Graves avoids this pitfall by maintaining a focus on dialectic and process.\nGenerative Friction\nAs you might imagine – there can be quite a tension between existential conditions and the formation of ‘emergent coping mechanisms’. This friction is perhaps akin to the myth of Sisyphus pushing a boulder uphill for all of eternity. Once a local maximum is reached in this seemingly open ended system, the boulder rolls back down again to a new local minimum. Once more we begin work on our next existential challenge!\nSo, having now acquainted ourselves with the various psychological conceptions; and more importantly the process of structural coupling which occurs between actor and environment, the most interesting questions (for me) become:\n\nwhat actually occurs during this generative process of transformation?\nand how do such bio-psycho-social phase shifts happen?\n\nLets zoom in on the transformative process as articulated by Graves:\n1. Potential\nThe necessary “higher order structures” must be present within the organism – which Graves saw as neurological systems within the brain. Unfortunately, further resolution on this matter has eluded me during the course of my Gravesian investigations.\nDąbrowski’s work on positive disintegration may be relevant however. Here he points to the factors of over-excitability, personal capabilities and drive for autonomy as significant factors in the development of an “independent personality”. At the organisational level, we might speculate that these structures could be represented by the variety of people, rituals, values, coordination protocols, practices and memetics available within a group or environment.\n2. Resolution of existential problems\nStages of expanding (and contracting) awareness cannot be skipped or bypassed. Problems faced at earlier stages of existence must be resolved in order to release psychic energy for advance. First things first!\n3. Feelings of dissonance\nA breakdown of solutions to one’s immediate existential problems MUST be faced along with a period of crisis and regression. The dissonance of this situation is required to catalyse biochemical changes that drive a regressive search for old patterns of behaviour in order to establish a previous apparent solution to the situation. Such a search is certain to end in arrestment, regression or growth as old solutions to previous problems DO NOT apply to the new context any better than the way of life whose inadequacy triggered the initial search. This might be considered a form of psychological bifurcation.\n4. Gaining of insights\nPutting an end to the regressive search, unlocking the formation of new structures and propelling an evolution to the next modality, is insight. This insight MUST enable the organism to find an equilibrium in the immediate environment.\n5. Removal of barriers\nWhen this insight is reached, few in the environment will share the same understanding and thus the barriers of friends, family, processes etc. must be overcome or ignored to make a leap.\n6. Opportunity to consolidate\nThe last necessary condition for the emergence of new structures is a consolidation factor which comes into play as the organism begins to practice and affirm the new behaviour. Here the implementation of insights are being achieved and accomplished.\nAt this point I feel compelled to speculate that uncovering this transformative process is probably where Graves got most stuck, leading to delays publishing his work and frustrations mentioned at the beginning of this article. To my senses the above list is a rough hexad within and animating the enneagram of process - though I doubt Graves personally realised this. My own belief is that that this would prove a fruitful line of inquiry for anyone looking to enrich Graves’ work as the non-linear temporalities reveal a lot about the transformative journey. The apokritikal levels of being that Graves describes as psychological modalities were not unfamiliar to Sufi schools and other mystery traditions.\nEngaging with transformation\nOk, so now having grokked the various conceptions and the deeper process of transformation; how do we leverage this understanding? Can it be used to help us judge appropriate actions in a given context to empower both ourselves and other individuals while navigating transition? What insights might really help us help us to flourish?\nPerhaps the first key is to accurately diagnose the terrain we’re traversing before figuring out what’s needed and/or desired before prioritising an appropriate pattern, schema or modality to enables us to overcome the obstacles in our way?\nLet’s sample a selection of potentially useful approaches:\nIn most modern cultures, the [AN] and [BO] stages are primarily found in toddlers. Learning is through habituation and essentially Pavlovian conditioning; an associative linear process whereby stimulus provokes a response. The classic example is a dog drooling while its dinner is being prepared, but the same process also applies in large to dementia and substance addiction (e.g. a junkie searching out a bag of heroin).\nFor a loose cannon at the [CP] stage, benevolent autocracy is perhaps warranted? This might perhaps sound draconian but given complete freedom inhabitants of this modality will absorb as much space as possible while openly fleecing others of their agency; if you give an inch, they’ll take a mile. Graves references B.F. Skinner, August Aichhorn and Kurt Eisler as relevant therapies stating “you put this person in a box psychologically and you don’t let him out. You’ve got to know and accept those rules!”. Most subsistence modalities will have immense difficulties dealing with this conception due to the limitations of their own ontology.\nWorking with the [DQ] stage, Graves suggests Freud is pretty much the only person who ever had a clue. These subjects need gentle hand-holding and a personal relationship in order to overcome their fears, break down unhelpful positions and foster trust… thereafter moving along at a snail’s pace to lead them back into a sense of embodied self. These people need to see the engaging party as an acceptable authority figure or they’ll remain hidden in their shell without conceding an inch.\nThe [ER] modalities gain insight only from what they can procure for themselves, gauging their expectations against outcomes. In this regard encounter groups where people gather to express felt experiences arising out of personal interactions are good places to receive useful feedback. Worth noting here however is if the (out) group is unknown to the [ER] centred psychology it would seem that they will often observe and leverage the weakness of others members of the group to exploit and instrumentalise them. They need to interact with a known group with real stakes and repercussions.\nFor those centred in an [FS] modality, Graves held that the Rodgerian approach was “a very fine one”. Many of these methods are similar to the [ER] interventions minus the training wheels of a known group. Particular methods such as the Rodgerean Argument he seemed to consider more suitable than others. As the [FS] modality has embarked on a journey of self-exploration they are predominantly asking “why?” questions which means than an authentic and congruent 1:1 relationship facilitates deeper inquiry and shared context.\nWe’ll stop here as [GT] and [HU] conceptions are open on all channels, learning from every encounter and situation. The main difference between these modes is the maturity; [GT] often seeming to be a kind of potential junkie, and maybe [HU] as somewhat more cautious.\nReflections\nWhile writing this document and in the course of my own journey, I can say that the conceptions feel quite accurate and extremely useful tools of perception and diagnostics. Schemas are not something I’ll ever really take for gospel but the framework does seem to diagnose past behaviours with relatively high degrees of accuracy; I can see a cycle of personal conceptions that have repeatedly arisen and broken down again while oscillating upon the carrier wave of my life:\nBO &gt; CP: The modality throughout my teenage years was clearly that of deny-self. Socialised mind did its best to fit in with kin spirits and fill a group niche. This semi-autistic version of myself was eventually perturbed into a sense of self-awareness via romantic rejection and teenage heartbreak.\nCP &gt; DQ: Later during my university years I moved into an express-self modality. I was ferociously exercising, writing music prolifically while dating regularly. At one point in this cycle a dear friend of mine got fed up with the impulsive behaviour and hit me with the statement “you can’t just keep talking over people man” the shame of which once again perturbed my world view.\nDQ &gt; ER: My early career seems to accurately fit a deny-self modality where I felt quite disembodied; watching myself in third person while smoking away external tensions as a form of escapism. I was working for a particularly imperialistic employer and the thought of further subordinating myself to such tyrannical authority was really grating on me so when the opportunity arose I quit my job and started a company of my own.\nER &gt; FS: As captain of my own ship I moved into an express-self modality; installing sound systems for several high end venues in London while also beginning to invest in speculative assets. I expanded into night club tech management and eventually burnt myself out on graveyard shifts – moving into a well paid technology job shortly thereafter. My calculated boundary pushing there provoked push back and brought down the wrath of others, eventually leading to being made redundant as the startup began to run out of funding in the great ETH crash of 2018. Yeah, I was a brat.\nFS &gt; GT: Leaving the world of employment behind to search out like minded peers seems to accurately reflect the “deny-self for acceptance now” conception; I joined a variety of self-organising initiatives and after some time found refuge in the countryside messing about with crypto robotics with a peer. The pace was slow and the location isolating so a sense of dissonance began to creep in; resultantly I was moved to affirm myself and began to seek stability on my own ground by taking a job as a Ledger Governance Coordinator and moving to Berlin before quickly pivoting to Lisbon instead.\nIt appears that many sources suggest that the FS &gt; GT transition is the hardest to work through. However, the reasoning for these assertions seem quite mysterious and thin on the ground and so I feel compelled to share my own experience of this transition. Stated bluntly the end of the green transition felt like I’d been stripped of all character leaving a whisper of core essence that was pretty unresponsive and completely spaced out. Veg mode.\nThe upside to that however was an honest sense of self-awareness which seemed to become a process of rebuilding my “avatar” in a systematic way from the ground up unintentionally taking on the properties of each stage that seemed to change about every three months or so. There was also a growing sense of self-acceptance (which I thought I’d already found) coming from an open disclosure of my internal world. This was probably the end of the FS stage.\nAutonomy and independence certainly came at a cost but life became both more colourful and difficult as I entered the GT stage; my experience of this transition was that the involution cycle felt pretty dark. The GT modality seems to be refilling on potential that previously withered away so a whole bunch of high capacity chaos cats seem to emerge and get real frigging tricky with each other.\nThere’s a sense of fear and paranoia among individuated peers while reality turns into a warzone as individuals competing for agency rug each other for the realisation of their potential… leading to the unitive HU transformation; though I honestly can’t quite comment on that part of the journey in detail just yet other than to say that I’m frigging exhausted from the involution cycle.\nCommentary\nWhile exploring and reflecting on this model, I’ve taken it with a pinch of salt and largely read between the lines. From this perspective it feels pretty solid and I honestly don’t have a huge amount of criticism to direct at in. Taking a more literal perspective however it seems that some of the terminology might benefit from minor adjustments in framing.\nIn particular Graves seems to frame the process from a lens of coping and problem solving which we might say is a form of goal orientation. This seems at odds with his otherwise predominant process orientation and so we can perhaps view the transitions as a process of healing from damage incurred in prior modalities.\nThroughout this article I’ve also been cautious not to call the conceptions “levels” – as many transcripts do – because such words can easily lead to a sense of elitism. This is rife in the Spiral Dynamics communities which draw upon this work and tends to turn many people off. Graves himself noted in a number of transcripts that “levels’’ were uncorrelated with intelligence and that it’s more a case of understanding how people do what they do, or how they believe what they believe.\nWhile it seems that the research methods were generally robust; the [AN] and [BO] conceptions were inferred through extensive study of anthropological literature as previously mentioned. This seems fair in the context of his study and a necessary step to avoid the immediacy bias of solely relying on his own sample; however by looking for conceptions outside his sample and finding them it opens the potential for confirmation bias. Ahh, the thin line and endless double bind!\nConclusion\nIt seems apparent to me at this point that Emergent Cyclical Theory has a wide range of implications across a number of fields; particularly in government, business, healthcare, education and social sciences. We might thereby consider it an aid for anticipating potential futures, or as a lens for systemic intervention - with the right eyes and ears it can help enable us to tailor an appropriate response to a given context and meet it in place with right (or deliberately wrong) action!\nFurthermore, Emergent Cyclical Theory seems pretty applicable to emerging fields like distributed ledger technology, artificial general intelligence and computer science - as they are all artefacts of our ontologyes and how we think.\nThese encoded ideologies are the products of our environmental coupling which then become concrete realities which shape the affordances of our daily lives. Having an awareness of what’s shaping us and the modality that created it is an incredibly important notion to be aware of… and perhaps even more so in the reverse; how we’re using our agency to shape the world and others around us is a deep ethical concern that we can probably all be more aware of. How are we contributing? What values are driving our actions and behaviour? How much hubris is involved?\nNavigating the tensions present in daily life feels analogous to matching voltage or impedence; wherever there’s an ontological mismatch there’s a energetic bottleneck that restricts flow and leaks potential. Stepping and blending these energetics is an art form I could personally use more practice in but having a good sense of where others are coming from is certainly helpful in attempting such alchemy!\nPerhaps beyond this is a notion of situationism; the conjuring of moments which enable us to grow in safe to fail environments at the collective scale. Performance events and circumstances which test our capacities and surface our ontologies for what they are; fragile beliefs, attachments and conditioned patterns. As Graves initially pondered; can exposure to confusion, contradiction, controversy and conflict help us to become better adapted to our existential environment? I personally believe so but buyer beware; this can be absolutely exhausting when sustained over long periods of time!\n“Buy the ticket, take the ride”\nAd Astra ✨,\njosh\n\nReading\n\nThe Never Ending Quest - Clare Graves\nSpiral Dynamics - Beck and Cowan\nA Brief History of Everything - Ken Wilbur\nModel of Hierarchical Complexity – Michael Commons\nPiaget\nLovinger\n\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/expositions/semiotics/","title":"Semiotics in Brief","description":null,"body":"\nIntroduction\nSemiotics is essentially the study of significance, or as it is often put the study of signs, signifiers and the signified. While no expert on Peirce, the patterns of his thinking seem to be foundational thinking within Bennetts theories on the qualitative significance of number, or Hodgsons Qualsystems/Qualitative Systems Thinking. Personally speaking, this is what makes Peirce’s work interesting for me.\nPeirce defines semiosis as the action of signs; which can be thought of as the dynamic correlation between objects, signs and interpretants. In this case objects are a form of presentation, signs are a form of re-presentation, and interpretants are the inferential communicative meanings.\nPeirce articulates a form of ternary logic based on categories are called 1stness, 2ndness and 3rdness. To my reasoning equate to schemas like Gurdjieffs active, passive, reconciling or Bennetts function, being, will or Landrys immanant, omniscient, transcendental. These are essentially qualities that can be found in everything, though Peirce starts from his own entry point and attributes his own specific meanings to these descriptions.\nCategories\nThe first category, 1stness, is analogous to Bennetts function; an essentially pure quality that exists without relationship and is separate from any object. The Greeks probably would have called this an ‘accident’, or a ‘property’ of something with the possibility of embodiment like colours of feelings. Monism.\n2ndness then appears to be a form of dyadic being in relation to another; subject and object, cause and effect, action and reaction, dependence and independence, here and now, force and resistance, essential and existential, first and last, nihilism and eternalism, nominalism and positivism, etc. Relation here seems to be defined largely through opposition.\n3rdness then appears to be a continuum between things, mediation and regulation of patterns which enable us to gain information and learn about the state of affairs. Bennett would probably attribute dynamism and reconciliation as properties belonging to this category, as would seem proper, and this seems implicit in Peirce.\nCorrelates\nBased on these three categories Peirce establishes three classes; presentation, representation and interpretation:\n\nThe first class is the sign itself, regardless of what the object is represents or the effect it produces. What can be said about the sign or object directly? What’s it’s tone, token or type?\nThe second class is about how the sign represents an object regardless of effect. How does the sign stand for or denote a related object? Is it an icon, index or symbol?\nThe third class describes the communicative effects such as emotions, actions or thoughts. How does the sign represent its object to the interpreter? Is it a term, proposition or argument?\n\nNine Genuine Types of Sign\nCrossing correlates and categories and we get the ‘nine genuine types of sign’\nCorrelate 1 (+)Correlate 2 (-)Correlate 3 (=)\n1stness (+)QualisignIconRhema\n2ndness (-)SinsignIndexDecisign\n3rdness (=)LegisignSymbolArgument\n\nAt this point the terms within each column needs a little explaining so let’s dig in.\nQualisign refers to a qualitative sign that is as pure as pure potential can be, meaning that it’s a completely abstract tone. Found for instance as a pure colour or timbre.\nSinsign refers to an impulse that exists and imposes into the world here and now seperated from reason - this is otherwise referred to as a token. For example the sound of thunder or a note.\nLegisign then refers to a type of law, rule or convention that is general or universal in nature. Examples that come to mind are chord constructions like major sevenths, which then regulate and determine the particular notes, or alternativly a mathmatical formula that governs a set of variables.\nIcons are signs based on similarities or resemblances, in other words they are forms of mimicry that in a pure form would have no marked differences. One can take art as an example, where an illustration would represent the life model.\nIndexes then are signs based on material or causal connections, the key words being matces or fit; for instance finger prints represent the lines on your hand. You could also say that measurements like weight or tempreture are indexes too.\nSymbols then are signs where the relation to an object is based on habbitual conventions, an example of which might be the emergency exit where icons are used to explain an idea in reference to a physical index (the door below it). These have been called idons in other languages and domains.\nRhema is an ephemearal qualitity with the possibility of interpretation such as a sensation or feeling. As it’s of a subjective nature that can neither be affirmed or denied, rhema conveys no factual information. Logically rhema can be concieved of as a proposition without a subject; “___ is a state”.\nA dicisign as the concrete instance then claims factual information about the world. It can be considered the result of an inductive proposition, where a hypothesis is tested through experiment. For example “42 is the meaning of life, existence and everything” represents a claim which upon interpretation can be affirmed or denied.\nAn argument then poses a conclusion to the union of many propositions as a necessary answer which produces an ordered and lawful effect. Such sequenced propositions guide us toward a conclusion with purpose. Formal logic like syllogism, guiding principles or meta structures can be considered arguments.\nTen Genuine Signs\nAt this point it’s very tempting to draw an enneagram with the above categories and correlates, which would probably be structured 1-9 around the edges of a circle in the order of writing; and most likely the inner hexagram would reveal some interesting information about the linkages (such an assertion boarders on dicisign).\nHowever, Peirce did something else that was quite interesting, he derrived ten triadic configurations by combining categories and correlates based on as simple rule of allowing movements of only sideways or up; these, he called the ‘ten genuine signs’. If your serious about this material, and my description of this method doesn’t make sense to you, you can reverse engineer the process by comaring the triads and formalisms with the nine types above while looking for patterns.\nFormalismTriad of termsDescription\n111Qualisign, Icon, RhemaA sign of possibility is precieved to be, similar to a possible object, producing a possible emotional effect\n211Sinsign, Icon, RhemaAn individual sign is considered to be, connected to an existent object, producing a possible emotional effect\n221Sinsign, Index, RhemaAn individual sign is considered to be, similar to an existent object, producing a possible emotional effect\n222Sinsign, Index, DeicsignAn individual sign is considered to be, similar to an existent object, producing an actual energetic effect\n311Legisign, Icon, RhemaA habitual sign represents, the qualities of its object, producing a possible emotional effect\n321Legisign, Index, RhemaA habitual sign represents, by being existentially connected to it, producing a possible emotional effect\n322Legisign, Index, DecisignA habitual sign represents, by being existentially connected to it, producing an actual energetic effect\n331Legisign, Symbol, RhemaA habitual sign represents, its object by a habbit producing, a possible emotional interpretation\n332Legisign, Symbol, DicisignA habitual sign represents, its object by a habbit producing, an actual energetic interpretation\n333Legisign, Symbol, ArgumentA habitual sign represents, its object by a habbit producing, a general logical interpretation\n\nThat’s the baisics of the theory in a nutshell, though Peirce talked of many other interesting things that are worth learning about of which I’ve barely scratched the surface of myself. For example, he considered Philosophy to be constructed from phenomenology, normative science and metaphysics. Double clicking on normative science, he considered this to be constructed of ethics (action), aesthetics (feeling) and logic (thought).\nIf your into qualitive systems thinking and cognitive semantics, Peirce is a pretty interesting writer to steep in for a while. Although he argues that terniary logic is both necessary and sufficient for proper reasoning as everything higher order systems are made of binar or ternary pairings, he still takes his investigations to further depths by varying combinations (e.g. his 6 universal predicments) and tracing paths (10 genuine signs).\nIn my view he could go further unfolding the qualitive significance of number but unearthed and articulated some important foundations none the less, and for that we owe him a debt of grattitude.

Well Brian Wilson was arguably the driving talent behind most of their sucess; he wrote most of the songs, the arrangements, hired the musicians and ran the studio production. Obviously “Pet Sounds” was the album that reached fame and critical acclaim due to the pioneering studio productions on the hit “Good Vibrations”.\nWhat many people don’t know however is that there was a follow up album that made use of the same pioneering techniques as “Good Vibrations” that was was LOST for 40 years. This was Brians masterpiece, which finally saw the light of day in 2004. Naturally, there’s an incredible story behind the albums history, with several documentaries like “Beautiful Dreamer” available that one should really take the time to watch for themselves. As such, I’ll leave that aspect alone.\nAnyway, thanks to members of “The Wondermints” helping Bryan get back on track - particularly Darian Shanana - the 2004 version SMiLE is frankly the most spiritual album your likely to find for miles; the ProTools recording is an audiophiles wet dream with luscious vocal harmonies, wall of sound instrumental arrangements (inclusive of barritone harmonicas) and a brilliant sense of psychedelic humour!\nAs a concept album, there are several elemental themes woven into the albums fabric.

The bands first album “Based on a True Story” (aka BOATS) with its acrostically evocative album cover is probably the bands most popular work, although Blackbird has a sense of ratna earthyness that shouldn’t be ignored.\nThe production of both albums are top notch; high quality recordings, strong arrangements, soulful vocals, nuanced and expressive lyrics - vibes all round.\nIf you ask me, pretty much all all the tracks on BOATS are strong, though if you’d like something to illustrate my earlier claims then “Ray Ray” is a good track to try on for size with it’s muted bass lines, sharply polished lazer beam SFX and smooth vocals. For those that enjoy contrast, the pimped out producion of Ray Ray eases off the gas by moving into “Dark Days” which tastes more organic, dynamic and emotive. Let the acoustic, horns, crash and brushed snare sweep you into the ebb and flow of a three four waltz; for me this song really embodies the heart of the psychedelic experience and what it means to be human.\nBlackbird is a different vibe; still distinctly the Drop but the music has a different feel thats murkier and perhaps more magic mushrooms than LSD. The tracks have a looser and more lumpy quality than the ones found on BOATS. The standout track for me on this album is “Mother Mother” due to its exceptionally smooth transition from acoustic band into a more synthy electro pulse before fade out.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/floatingpoint/","title":"Floating Points","description":null,"body":"\n\n\n\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/ghost/","title":"Ghost","description":null,"body":"Albums: Impera, Meliora\nHaving seen the Tobias Forge - Ghosts songwriter - on the covers of numerous music mags over the years I initially dismissed them based on the pantomine image.

From any one of his three bands to his businesses and vineyards. The quality of his output is also extremely high, all the albums listed above sound great and come with all the bells and whistles of premium merch and so forth. A born performer!\nTools last two records are particularly note worthy due to the detailed arrangements and production values. Fear Innoculum in particular has a smooth coalescence that is eloquently whole and complete. If you trace back the bands history it will become quite apparent that this is the finished product; 10,000 days is really strong, though rougher around the edges - as with the albums prior to that. The advantage to these earlier albums however are the esoteric Easter eggs that correlate to fibonnachi ratios, or tracks that can be layered over each other.\nMusically the band is a full package; rhythmically, harmonically, melodically interesting with highly refined messaging. Many of the tracks sound extremely organic due to the odd time signatures like 7/8 or 5/4. This tends to move about as well. Favorite Tool tracks include “Jambi”, “The Pot” and “Vicarious” from 10,000 Days and perhaps “Invincible” or “Decending” from Fear Innoculum though it’s a harder album to pick from due to the self similar cohesiveness of the tracks.\nPuscifer then are another vibe, much less esoteric and more of a comedy show or drama than anything. It’s quite something. You get all sorts of characters and narratives popping out of this setup; seemingly a parody on life, or maybe the three gunas who then give rise to the wheel of samsara. Musically Pusifer are more versitile and experimental than Tool or APC, which has a charming novelty, though at the cost of consistency which is quite honestly advertised as SPAM. Tracks to dig on would be the title track of “Conditions of My Parole”, which is a really solid album with tracks like “Monsoons” “The Weaver”, “Green Valley” and then other tunes like “Bread and Circus” and “Bullet Train to Iowa” from the album Existential Reckoning (#IamTheBriefcase).\nA Perfect Circle are then much closer to Tool than Pusifer.

Of course “Get Lucky” with Pharell Williams was the big splash but “Give Life Back to Music” and “Loose Yourself to Dance” are arguably better pieces of craft.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/robertfripp/","title":"Robert Fripp","description":null,"body":"Albums: In the Court of the Crimson King, Lizard, Red, The Power to Believe\nRobert Fripp of King Crimson is arguably one of the most diciplined musicians out there, practicing six hours a day in order to perform near impossible arrangements like “FracKture” with a triple band lineup consisting of some of the best musicians on the plannet. It’s a pretty impressive lineup!\nThe band made their debut in 1969 with the album “In the Court of The Crimson King” which is their most famous by a long shot - you know, the one with the iconic screaming face. Apparently their first performance of “21st Century Schitzoid Man” in Hyde Park left the audience so disoriented that people forgot to clap the Rolling Stones onto stage!\nFor many years I found “Red” the most appealing album as it feels particularly whole and exhibits some incredible compositions. The album was titled “Red” because the band broke so many formal musical rules that if you submitted it for a music school exam you’d have received the report back full of red crosses. As suggested by such a story, the album breaks boundaries and sounds incredible having been recorded at Air Lyndhurst in London - the studio George Martin (the fifth Beatle) bought and refitted. The tracks “One More Red Nightmare” and “Starless” are in my opinion highlights of the album.\nAnother enthralling album is “The Power to Believe”, which displays quite some virility. It’s a modern album with electronic instruments, bone crushing guitars and some luscious moments of release. The rhythms, textures, compositions and technicality are vital elements of the resultant soundscape. You probably won’t find anything like it anywhere else; incredibly creative and powerful stuff that’s akin to a non-traditional gamelan.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/robertplant/","title":"Robert Plant","description":null,"body":"Album: Mighty Rearranger, Dreamland\nWhile a lot of Robert Plants solo work doesn’t really float my boat, Mighty Rearranger is absolutely fantastic! “Another Tribe” starts the album with a rhythmic vitality that beams sunshine everywhere, which is appropriate given the second track is called “Shine It All Around”. This track is another winner on the production given it’s many layred vocals and huge echo effects on the chorus - hard to believe it was recoded in a small Welsh studio. At the end of the album there’s also a drum and bass remix of this tune which is pretty nice. Roberts not lost his voice or soul even at this stage of his career.\nHonourable mentions as well to the album Dreamland which is also pretty strong; particularly “Darkness, Darkness” and his cover of Dylan’s “One More Cup Of Coffee”. Of course we could add a lot of the Zeppelin stuff here as well but I’m deliberately avoiding review of obvious classics as those trails are known.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/snarkypuppy/","title":"Snarky Puppy","description":null,"body":"Albums: We Like it Here, Family Dinner\nA well composed cosmopolitian fusion of jazz, funk, rock, blues, hip hop, electro and soul.

These virtues come courtesy of the well thought out arrangements, the best jazz musicians of the time in some of the best studios. Apparently a descriptive term applied to them by a journalist at one point or another was “Yacht Rock”, which is quite apt!\nIn funny sort of way, Steely Dan are actually kind of like a cynical version of Byran Wilson. The genius is certainly there with their cream of the crop arrangements, artsy lyrics, unusual instruments and so forth - so the real difference is the tone and taste… Dan as you might suspect are less innocent and a dollop more dark.\nAlbum wise the Royal Scam is probably my favourite of the lot, though Aja is one of the most famous.

Besides his main band Porcupine Tree and his solo career, he is also King Crimsons mix and mastering engineer (amongst many other bands, particularly in Prog).\nPorcupine tree has relatively large discography, though generally speaking I’ve found the cream begins to rise from “Fear of a Blank Planet” onwards. This is roughly the period when Gavin Harrison joined the band, who you might recognise as 1/3 of Crimsons Rhythm section; naturally he is one a hell of a drummer.\nGuitars, synths, bass and vocals are all arranged tastefully across Wilsons work too. Things tend to get more jazzy as Porcupine Tree ages, though that’s not to say that C/C is soft by any means. This is evidenced by the extremely gritty telecasters on tracks like “Rats Return” which is a bone crusher of a riff… Not to mention “Herd Culling”.\nTrying out Wilsons solo stuff you’ll find that it’s more eclectic; the Harmony Codex being more electronic in nature though it’s still characteristic of his unique style with complex vocal harmonies and textured layers.

Ok, well, Sturgil keeps things safe by keeping to familiar progressions and standard time signatures, though he does a fantastic job of making them interesting. He even recognises and discloses the recursivity of his writing in the lyrics of “All Said and Done”!\n\nKeep staring at the pages, coming up with the same lines,It’s all been said and done by now, two or three times.\n\nThis however is not surprising (as he knows how to wield the pen) because the line is also symbolic of the essence of his breakthrough album which was title called “Meta-modern Sounds in Country Music”. Yep, psychedelic country music. You can’t find a larger market than country music so he pretty much nailed the business strategy for going mainstream! (intentional or otherwise)\nHinted at by the album title “A Sailors Guide to Earth” and reading between the lines of “Welcome to Earth Pollywog” and “Keep Between The Lines” it seems pretty obvious that the albums intended as a time capsule for his newborn child. In particular I’d recommend the track “Brace For Impact” for its lyrics framed by a particularly solid bass line chugging the title into life (what a shaker in the chorus!). The motown vibe throughout this album also has an authenticity to it akin to the Muscle Shoals sound.\nIf your a fan of the Danger Mouse sound (Black Keys), then you’ll appreciate the production of Sound and Fury, which exemplifies the style - for instance painting in the drums of “Best Clock Maker on Mars” which has a precise and unrelenting shuffle. The aesthetic of switching radio stations is pretty creative too and reminds me of Pink Floyds “Wish You Were Here”. Once the blistering guitars get too intense (they do), your treated to some melting moments of release like in the tune “Make Art, Not Friends”; as such I’d suggest sticking with the tension and listening to the album straight through from start to finish… oh and “Remember to Breathe”! ;)\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/sylvainrichards20syl/","title":"Sylvain Richards (20SYL)","description":null,"body":"Albums: Tetra, The Upper Hand\nSylvain Richard is the multi-potentiate creator behind Hocus Pocus, C2C, 20syl, Alltta and a number of other artistic endevours.

After listening through a couple of times the album really grew on me and I’ll happily say that Wolfmother are innovating in a field with little room left to maneuver - Cosmic Egg being the jewel in their discography.\nPersonally speaking, I’m favorable to the ralentandos (tempo shifts) and arpeggios on “Eyes Open” and “Violence of the Sun”.

Given the name you’d be forgiven for thinking its a book about art, though in many ways it is, more appropriately it’s about the art of right living - with art as the vehicle.\nTrungpas is an eloquent writer and his content is easy to read; this is in part probably due to his clear semantic framing, though he rarely settles for stable definitions instead offering multiple perspectives on the same thought object.\nAn example of this is the definition of “Dharma Art” itself which he describes in three different ways within the first chapter alone:\n\nnon-aggression and total confidence,\nunselfconsciousness and directness,\nvision and operation.\n\nHere he makes it clear that art is not supposed to be exhibitionism, which is clumsy and aggressive, instead he asserts that it should be the production of beauty - though not at the expense of others. He draws a distinction between Dharma Art and elegance, and that work for others brings delight while work on the self brings elegance. This brings out what is honest, real and earthy.\nFrom here we move into a discussion on vision; differentiating between “Great Eastern Sun” and “Setting Sun” - which are defined from a number of perspectives.\nGreat Eastern Sun is:\n\nFearless (Power, energy, strength)\nWakeful (No doubt, hesitation or regret)\nBrilliant (all pervasive goodness)\n\nThis vision is also described as having a sense of dignified confidence that is peaceful and non-aggression. Trungpa says that Great Eastern sun is a fearless victory over the three worlds of man, heaven and earth - though peaceful and shows the path, so we must develop ourselves first before we can properly engage.\nDue to this development, there forms a goodness in the self which projects decency and creates trust with an audience due to the purpose of affirming an enlightened society. This wakefulness consists of luminosity, energy and brilliance - without doubts, hesitations or regrets.\nSetting Sun on the other hand is described as a lack of bravery and complete cowardice, a constant fear that’s deliberately suicidal and wants to go to sleep; this is egoistic passion, ignorance and aggression.\nThis brings us on to the notion of “Basic Goodness” which is foundation of man heaven and earth. Man in particular should be generous and brave (dyad), wakeful, open minded and enlightened (triad) - which is the first set of Bhuddist iconographies.\nIt would seem that this gives rise to harmony which is described as plentiful, rich and minimal. Or alternatively as luscious, rich, open and spacious; “like a Jewish mother in a Japanese home” - which is in itself a pretty fearless caricature.\nTo reach such basic goodness Trungpa asserts that a meditation practice is needed; preferably in the Shamatha Vipashyana tradition, which means ‘mindful’ and ‘aware’. The realisation being that Form and Dharma are non existent and therefore cant mix, similarly there is a fuzzy boundary between openness and action. In this way art is an awareness practice that opens perspective to create focus, as opposed to a mindfulness excersize. This “Art in Everyday Life” is non possessive and non aggressive.\nBy the time we get to the chapter on “Ordinary Truth” we are at a point where we are prepared for the discussion of theistic symbolism and non theistic symbolism… or as Trungpa puts it “cosmic trips” and “everything has a place”… yes, it seems that’s indeed a shot in the foot for this blog. Oh dear.\nRegardless, this is elaborated on in the chapter “Empty Gap of Mind” as Absolute symbolism (no reference point) and Relative symbolism (symbolic references). The former is passionless, egoless and has no discursive thought. The latter he claims is based on passion, demandingness, restlessness and aggression.\nAbsolute symbolism, Trungpa claims, has a nature like the sky or space, in that it’s unborn and unceasing, though it lives in the hearts of all sentient beings. It cannot happen if there’s no place to birth it, hence a nature like space - or eternity.\nFrom this place we start to “colour our world” which is essentially letting go of the ego, or little “I” of aggression, passion and ignorance (setting sun). Ignorance being a state of basic panic, pain and bewilderment that stem from an allergy towards ourselves.\nHaving discarded these maladies, we begin to develop new sight and see things clearly, properly and directly. But what does “the process of perception” represent? That seems tricky…\n\n“The question of reality is confusing. Nobody knows. But everybody knows that somebody knows…”\n\nIf nobody knows but there is an answer out there somewhere, we have to rely on ourselves and learn to develop our own capacity to interpret ideas, suggestions and information. Reality is both comforting and confusing for these reasons as the real world is full of anxiety, pain and chaos. Trungpas remedy is a sitting practice to make friends with ourselves. He suggests that from such a place of non-aggression we can begin to see things without making demands and trying to buy or sell to others.\nIn this chapter, it would be wise to take Trungpas advice of thinking for ourselves onboard when he offers a description on how our perceptive process unfolds.\nFirstly he suggests that we see an object, secondly we mentally smell it as some kind of commentator comes along in the back of our head, then we hear the object from all around, before finally forming a relationship with it through touch and making some kind of judgement or decision. Indeed this seems based on the four term system of the “Karmas”, and such systems are representative of actions and decisions, rather than a full blown process of perception - which would likely take the form of a seven fold system.\nWith that caveat noted, Trungpas position that Dharma Art’s not really concerned with this “process”, at the end of the chapter, actually makes a lot more sense. This he suggests is like a frog sitting in the rain as a puddle forms around it with what amounts to essential indifference. However this doesn’t explain the process of perception as promised by the chapter title, though the next chapter “Being and Projecting” moves us towards such an understanding.\nThis begins with a description of the 12 Ayatanas, which are a symbolic reference to the sense perceptions and sense objects. The perceptions are thinking, seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, tasting, while the correspondent objects are mind, eye, ear, body, nose and tongue.\nIf we start with this position of “Frog in the Rain” or a sense of essential indifference, Trungpa suggests that we begin to project ourselves outwards in order to prove our existence, which then leads to a dance with the projection as it begins to unfold.\nReading between the lines here, we can determine that there are the six sense perceptions through which the dynamics of projector and projected interact. When placed together, this seems to form the outline of an enneagram; a triad within a broken hexad. Perhaps this implicitly gives rise to the “process of perception” promised by the chapter title? From the fragmets at the end of the page it would seem so.\nThe next chapter on “Lost Horizons” seems in many ways contradictory to Trungpas earlier statements - though the information still seems relevant; he starts by discussing relative symbolism and says “this does not refer to some superspiritual-materalistic vision based on altered neurological perceptions. It simply means an experience that transcends the common phenomena of good and bad, promises and threats” - which is effectively a 180º turn from the earlier affirmation that it was a “Cosmic Trip”.\nThis updated view suggests that it’s a form of visual perception developed through meditation and “without such taming of the mind, we either misjudge situations or are overpowered by them. We are unable to percieve things as they are in the fullest sense”. This feels like a more tempered perspective, given Trungpas own cognitive semantics are a form of relative symbolism. At the same time we can also note a change of attitude from being (‘frog in the rain’, ‘sitting bull’) to doing, such as jumping into “brilliant high energy pools” - though this is still distinguished from beautiful, fantastic and colourful.\n\nThe Tibeten Book of the Dead also says that if you go along with the bright and penetrating visions, you might be saved; whereas if you are facinated by the beautiful, fantastic, colorful visions, you might be trapped in the samsaric rebirth cycle again and again.\n\nIts worth paying close attention to the semantics of the words used at this point as for a laymen like myself the terms can be easily conflated. It seems the words bright and penetrating are likely used in reference to the five wisdoms; mirror like awareness, discernment, sameness, knowlege of the phenomenological dimension and acomplishment. Rather than what Trungpa would probably call a ‘Cosmic Trip’ (as beautifully illustrated by this very site ;).\nWhatever the case this chapter is a radical call out about substituting the real for the imaginary, and never quite catching the fish in the net. What Trungpa calls the lost horizon, which sends a few shocks.\nThe remedy to this he suggests is “Giving”, though this is not what you might think it means. The chapter starts by noting that the desire to learn more and more is questionable as a form of agression is taking place and how such posessive demands makes us deaf, dumb and blind - a veil preventing absolute symbolism.\nInsted Trungpa recomends giving up, opening up and surrender as a means of ridding ourselves of agression. Paradoxically, this may actually mean giving into agression in order to let it go because you couldn’t care less. It consequentially seems the point is giving in all senses, exhaling everything to the point that scales fall from your eyes and your (true) perception becomes clear, direct and precice.\n\n“Once we stop rejecting the world, it begins to pounce on us. Symbolism is imposed on us”\n\nNow, we get into the realm of “self existing humour”, which as a first principal is otherwise cosmic and breaks down the distinction between you and I. The ground from which it arises is a sense of all pervasive space or ground thats not messed up, paired with an appreciation of the play of phenomenona - perhaps otherwsise termed “Lila”.\nFor me this resonates, as I’ve been many characters in the course of my journey and am starting to see them back. By no means do I have mirror like awareness, but at times I find myself getting frustrated at charaters I’ve been before - which when noticed on reflection is actually quite a hillarious CirKus or cosmic ecology!\nThis really is an odd teapot of energetics, totally nuts, but bringing it back to Trungpa he suggests that peaceful energy is harmless, benevolent and pacifying - arising from warmth and encouragement. While wrathful energy is mocking and exposing. Sometimes our caricuture is savage and deadly, other times dignified and powerful. It’s not a lonely trip either, somebody else has been through it before and in many ways it’s all an act - yet an entirely real one!\nFrom here we move into a chapter called “Outrageousness” which seems to be the existential pole related to the essence of “non-agression”. Trungpa defines outrageousness as a direct conviction with a feeling of intense humour, energy and power penetrating inside - which makes a good deal of sense from the cosmic perspective of mirror like wisdom. There are a couple of traps here of course in relation to self-centredness, aggression and self-consciousness; in particular the presentation of the art or truth one has discovered (or is discovering).\n\n“The basic point is that there is a sense of continuity in your understanding of life. If you know who you are, what you are, where you are, and have something to say about that, you could share it with your fellow human beings. That’s fine. There’s nothing wrong with that, as long as you don’t want to publicize it. And even if you do want to publicize your embryonic discoveries, you don’t spell out the whole thing at once. It’s very tempting to spell everything out, which proves one’s legitimacy, one’s wisdom, or one’s artistry.”\n\nOutrageousness instead seems to be a sense of fearless celebration, which leads smoothly into the chapter on being a “Wise Fool”, who is open and inquisitive without frivolity or aggression; in other words a connection with reality and the phenomenal world that’s proper, gentle and generous.\nIn learning to interact with the world essentially, the discussion moves on to the “Five Styles of Creative Expression”. In many ways however, it may be better to interpret this core iconography as four styles with a neutral middle - which represents the all encompassing spaciousness and basic ground of the Bhudda (symbolised by the colour blue). We then have four other semantic coordinates.\n\n\nVajra, representing water with its clear and precise reflections. Its crisp like winter with colours of blue, white and gold. Its austere, cold and desolate, aliminium and metalic. It is the dawn rising in the east.\n\n\nRatna, representing earth with equinamity thats expansive and extending. It has a crisp Autumnal yellow to it. A rich and powerful sense of giving that’s dignified, opulent and regal, as well as a fertile, restless, earthyness thats solid and definite. It has a southern orientation.\n\n\nPadma, representing fire with a discriminating perception that sees detail. It has a spring facade to it that is red. It has no solidity or texture but is full of colour and glamour. It is concerned with output rather than input, with no concern to health or survival. It is connected with sunset and values reflection over being, art over science and practicality. It is brilliant, lucious and colourful, curvy and shapely like a lotus with a connection to wild flowers and roaming animals.\n\n\nKarma, representing wind and the automatic fulfilment of action. It’s colour is a summer green. It’s efficient, self-maintaining, active and growing with a sense of competition towards birthing something. Consequentially it has a sense of thunder and hail that can feel demonic and black, like a panther or understanding a thunder cloud.\n\n\nInverse to enlightened states, these houses also have neurotic states:\nBhudda can be spaced out rather than spacious\nVajra can be angry with intellectual fixation and ridgidity\nRatna can be fat and ostentatious, indulged to insanity\nPadma can be overly passionate, grasping, posessive with a desire to seduce the world\nKarma can be jealous, comparative and envious.\nBeyond this Trungpa distinguishes three levels of perception; experience, emptyness and luminosity. Experience just is - where “white is white” - while emptyness can be vacant or overcrowded (paradoxically leaving a lot of room, due to all the jostling life), lumonisoty then is something thats realised on the spot; which I personally interpet along the lines of creative improvisation - though it may be otherwise.\nHe says that perceptions are shifty, that they cant be reduced to words so much as their articulation takes us further from the reality - yet they are sharp, precise and tend to bring clarity. Open awareness should have a sense of connectivity, that everything is related to everything.\nIn choiceless magic he starts to speak of individuality, and with it the sense of confusion, uncertainty and chaos that arises. Here we have the choice of using the anxiety by making everything smooth, beautiful and fantastic - or turning the world into a training groundto learn more, which is suggested as preferable. This seems point at the experience of absolote symbology.\nOne key point in this chapter is in relation to the unification of everything, a group of individuals forming an organisation where everybody gets ‘turned on’ he considers a trip as such uniformity neglects individuality; in other words a consensus that “we are all playing the same game” is not considered Bhuddadharma. Same for the emulation of individuality.\nWith all this said, Trungpa does assert that there is a basic iconographic pattern to the universe, and that the intention should be to heighten individuality within the framework of some common world - which gets acknowleged as problematic at this point. Probably because of questions regarding frame.\nAt this point, my mind wanders into the teachings offered at H3uni.org and John Bennets work on General Systematics aka Qualsystems. Indeed, here is a community of individuals here holding a toolbelt of common frames; such frames are indeed a method of compressing and expressing reality into a low dimensional topology - much like bhuddist iconography.\nSuch models are useful in that they enable communication - though of course higher dimensional topologies do exist (like reality itself). “In the end, all barriers are broken through and bondages ‘annihilated’ - at that point there is room for that and this to be one”. Of course, such a perspective also has wider implications in relation to wholeness, morality, and the wider psychological enviroment of humanity.\n“One Stroke” continues along these lines with a discussion on forms of culture; pure culture derived from lineage and noncultural aesthetic expressions of meditation and devotion. This takes us into modern times and the lack of artistic lineage; since we lack a real teacher student relationship, Trungpa suggests the best path forward is to meditate a lot so that things become clearer and we develop a sense of continuity, dignity and mindfulness. Inspiration then comes from opensess and clear vision - the original Buhdda mind which is blank, nonterritorial, noncompetative and open.\nFrom this place it seems we can partake in “The Activity of Nonagression”, from which dignity emerges - a sense of gentleness and authentic-presence, which enables four actions or karmas. These seem to be synonomous with the Bhudda families above, with some expansion on the terms.\nPacifying has a sense of pure perception without sharp edges, and is related to a blue circle. Blue is related to pure sky with lots of space, and pure fresh air. Gentle and innately good, absent of neurosis and sees the world at its best.\nEnriching has a sense of richness, depicted as a yellow square with sharp corners. This relates to earth which creates boundaries for us, though also direction and has a sense of being, harmony and a well settled situation. There is also dignity, which relates to the intrinsic energy of our mind and mental state.\nMagnetising is depicted as a red half circle which is representative of emotions connected to the square earth, rounding it with reference points. This brings out passion, like an embrace or kiss, though also the meeting of minds. Richness without poverty allowing us to let go and be generous.\nKarma is depicted as a green triangle connected with activity and destruction. Green represents the strength and power of wind that is fearless. The triangle represents a dynamic balance between positive, negative and neutral - too much fearlessness becomes intellectual, too little becomes cowardice, which points to reconciling balance. Destruction relates to liberation and freedom as well, making it simple and clean cut.\nBy combining these colours we get lemon yellow and purple, imperial colours across history; the former connected with strength and the king principal, the latter with the ultimate feminine or queen principal.\nNow we arrive at a “State of Mind”, a form of wakeful magic that arises from our attitude in relation to ourselves, others and the world. Art involving a relation to ourselves and our phenomenal world gracefully. Grace implies none agression, gentleness and upliftedness - the basic attributes of cheerfulness, which enable us to beautify the world.\nWhere things go wrong is poverty - as despite talent, inteligence and vision artists have to struggle for money. Attitude and integrity become important. Trungpa suggest starting without the aim of money making, pure craft, and in working with others they begin to notice you as genuine, interesting, dedicated and brave. From such a place of gentle goodness, dedication and trueness, our work rises to another dimension - one that is uplifting visually, audibly and psychologically - visual Dharma that gives one a sense of composure that inspires richness, beauty and decorum. This can then hold the world together without causing schism.\nSeeing is distinguished from looking; first thought best thought, second thought maybe preferable. Impressions and then going beyond with a threefold logic of perception, appreciation and presentation; the ground, the path and then fruition. This logic can also be seen as the heaven, earth, human principal or the bodies of Tibetean vajrayana Bhuddism - dharmakaya, sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya. However they are described, they can be seen as background manifestation, potential manifestation and finally manifesting altogether.\nIn the Shambala tradition its “Heaven, Earth, Human”:\n\n\nHeaven is the coming down to earth with a sense of goodness, gentleness and togetherness. Looking down and conquering space with an unyeilding regality thats open and playful. The darkside is that tripping out on it could con you into situations through self-deception, so best start with first mind best mind - just a little dot on a blank page like primordial consciousness thats wakeful, delighted and briliant. From this state of mind and the right attitude and experience of space, comes what is known as blessing or sacredness. With no struggle we can relax and discover the sacred world without being smart or clever, whether mathmatically, technically or politically. This sacredness binds the heaven principle.\n\n\nEarth is then grounded and encompassing. Its first principal is the ‘absence of neurosis’ - defined as fixation or clinging that can be further articulated as passion which is too gluey or gooey, agression which is too sharp, threatening or rejecting, and ignorance, which is a state of stupour that cant discriminate black from white. As it is absent qualities the second principal suggests its ‘thorougly relaxed, soft and wholesome’. The third principal is ‘absence of lazyness’ so has a certain drive to achieve - no half-visions - as that would be breaking the morality and dicipline of artistic endevour. However as Earth is so gentle however, it may become overly domestic, or accomodating of everything - including chaos.\n\n\nHuman has two principals, the first being ‘freedom from subconscious gossip’; if our minds are full of thought it is due to a lack of relation to the heaven or earth principals. Executing work is one way to cut this. The second principal is ‘absence of regret’ be they in the past or future, looking back and forward all the time as a kind of slick but deep rooted depression that obscures heaven and earth - making us unproductive. The Human principal need not reference either heaven or earth, its just individual existence taking place, but when it does to binds heaven and earth together the universal monarch emerges. This king principal arises as a dynamic all three dharmas. Going back to “Basic Goodness” you might in other languages say this is the alchemical child; one that is both cute and daring, yet with openness and strength!\n“Endless Richness” emerges from this reconcilliation and things begin to flow. Like any craft you work with a technique for a long time and it then falls away. You just relate to the object of perception and adapt when things go wrong. An example of a participative movie is offered, which would require the interrelation of a lot of space, speed and richness. Which should make suggestions rather than feed information so they have to work and think about the presentation. Just a corner of knowlege.\nThis modality is related to teaching. Someone doing so by information alone may say wise and beautiful things, yet not know how to handle the gaps. Someone that lives the teaching however won’t fidget or blush, the teaching is engrained in their being so theres no embarassment at mistakes, things just go on and on, like waves of the ocean in endless richness. You recieve a lot, without feeling ‘dumped on’ because theres clearly much more to be said.\n\n\n“Back to square one” points at a moon that in turn points back at us with a mirror like essence. We shape our world in accord with our ideas, beliefs and dreams, which in turn haunt us and shape our being. He says that people get trapped in this creation and get trapped, seeing it as unjustified or undeserved. We then go so far as to discuss the suestion of spirituality, the ultimate level of judgement and the question of being fair to everybody. Perhaps this is the metaphor of Hungry ghosts?\nThinking before action is advised, though like everything this unfolds into questions of how to think, what to think about, why to think and so forth as you can think anything you want. He suggests that it should be directed, but not with dogma, philosophy or concepts. Instead we are “Back to Square One” - who or what thinks and whats the thinking process? It seems we must see ourselves and our thoughts to be genuinely uncoloured. Square one “is what it is”; desolate, spacious and without feedback. When we are forced to pounce, which will happen, we mess it all up - so staying with it and holding our ground seems to be the lesson, especially as theres no way to get out.\n\nWhen you have one, that indicates that you have two and three and four. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that you are going to get to square two and the rest of it. Then you have zero, which is not any kind of figure. It denotes nothing, I suppose. We want to be something, right? Even if we are back to square one, we are there, we are somethi. We dont’t wish te be nothing and we constantly try to avoid that. That is the problem. So the only alternative–not even alternative, but only choice, so to speak–is to be zero. So square one is the basic ground from which we function, and square zero seems to be beyound even our functioning. Isness, without any definitions. It is not so much branching out, but branching in. There is still resistance to going back to zero, and it has always been a problem that square one could be the excuse for you not to have to go back to zero. At least you have the number one to clench on to; at leas there’s that first number you made. You achieved your identity at square one, and that seems to be the problem. So ultimately, one has to return to zero. Then you begin to feel that you can move around. You can do a lot of things, not be numbered. You’re not subject to your own numbers, and you are not confined to a pidgeonhole. So your situation can be improved if you know that you have nothing bet vero, which is nothing. There’s no referenc point anymore, just zero. Try it. It is an expression of immense generosity and immense enlightenment.\n\nFrom zero, we can go to one - “Art Begins At Home” - Dharma art as natural awareness. Phrased another way, the Greek word “oikos” comes to mind, which is the root of economy and ecology. How we do one small thing is how we do everything - hence Dharma Art as a state of natural awareness.\nPerhaps this is the “Human” principal, which reconciles “Heaven and Earth”? Why do we label ourselves artists? Or cling to our mediums? Trungpa suggests that Dharma means “norm” or “truth” that is at peace and cool, reducing the heat of neurosis - a state before touching our brush or instrument.\n\n“For instance, you might go up in the mountains and catch a baby monkey and bring him home, hoping that little baby monkey can play on your shoulder, run around your courtyard, and play in your kitchen. You hope he will relieve your claustrophobia, the heat of your neurosis. When he first decides to come along with you, that baby monkey might behave himself. But over time he begins to become an extension of our neurosis… the same way as your artwork does”\n\nTalent then comes from the appreciation of basic beauty and basic goodness arising from the fundemental peace and coolness of dharma, at which point conflict begins to subside to clear perception. The purpose of a work of art is bodhisattva action; meaning that our production, manifestation, demonstration and performance should be geared towards waking people up from neurosis.\nFinally we are brought back to the closing statement on art and society “in Dharma art, what we are trying to do is tame our society, including ourselves”. Great Eastern Sun, Trungpa asserts, is humble and gentle with some additional qualities of precision, warmth, kindness.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/books/caravanofdreams/","title":"Caravan of dreams","description":null,"body":"","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/books/energiesmaterialvitalcosmic/","title":"Energies; material, vital, cosmic","description":null,"body":"\nHow come at points in my life I’m crackling with as much energy a tesla coil, while at other periods it feels as though I’ve a rubber soul? What determines the quality, quantity and intensity of this phenomena? Can answers be harnessed towards human flourishing at personal, local and global levels?\nWhile I have no clear answers, we might be able to draw some inferences based on John Bennetts lifetime of studies, in particular his schema of the twelve energy levels. These have also been taught at H3uni.org by Anthony Hodgson as part of the Cosmic Ecology course.\nHaving attempted to climb the mountain of John Bennetts Dramatic universe series myself, I can share from experience it’s an exceptionally dense rock of knowledge. The book “energies; material, vital, cosmic” is a set of crumbs from that ideas table, and significantly more digestible for such a reason - in other words what a bloody great book!\nEssentially the book is a set of lectures about Bennett’s twelve levels of energy and the pentadic diagrams used to articulate the eight cosmoses of reciprocal maintenance. As Gurdjieff would have put it, this schema is about learning “to do” through the “laws of world creation and maintenance” - though the material is more informative than pragmatic.\nWhat I mainly took from this book is a correction to my thinking process and some fresh inspiration for thinking about questions like “what is photosynthesis?” or “does free energy exist?”. Here Bennett’s descriptions of energetic levels and his systematic methodology for considering the relationships opens up a field of fresh insights, where in biology or the standard model of physics seems to get stuck.\nInvestigating material energies, we get some interesting relationships, and it may essentially be that Bennett outlines the keys to Teslas free energy as the crystalline cosmos. At the very least he seems to be waaay ahead of the curve detailing what appears to be extropic.ai’s hardware acceleration.\nIn this case the crystalline cosmos is composed of five energies; E12 dissipative, E11 directed, E10 cohesive, E9 tensile, E8 vital. The names are descriptive of their qualities, though can be substituted with other attributes, which help to further clarify their essence.\nSo by recycling heat, directing it, organising it, concentrating it and releasing it in a desired pattern an anabolic reaction is created. At the same time, inefficiencies in fitting the pattern and so forth creates a catabolic reaction which produces waste in the form of heat. It would seem that this can be maintained in perpetuity by a ‘sorting daemon’ which requires little if any energetic input by simply skimming the necessary energy from flows occurring between chambers, which is illustrated in the book.\nIn theory this sounds good but we still might want to test it out, although retroductivly drawing on personal experience it seems about on point regarding cycles of hyperstimulation and burn out. Coincidentally, in Bennetts schema of energies this ‘burn out’ modality may actually be the excessive weight of higher energies like conscious energy which is likened to a black flame, or the sun in Platos cave where those exposed to such energy wish to withdraw back into the comfort of darkness… Couldn’t tell you, but talk about an interesting reframe!\nSo that’s it for the book review, we can probably discuss the subject of energies in significantly more depth by using methods like systematics and qualsystems to tease out links and relationships between the modalities. The subject of another post however!\n","path":null}]
