Well Brian Wilson was arguably the driving talent behind most of their sucess; he wrote most of the songs, the arrangements, hired the musicians and ran the studio production. Obviously “Pet Sounds” was the album that reached fame and critical acclaim due to the pioneering studio productions on the hit “Good Vibrations”.\nWhat many people don’t know however is that there was a follow up album that made use of the same pioneering techniques as “Good Vibrations” that was was LOST for 40 years. This was Brians masterpiece, which finally saw the light of day in 2004. Naturally, there’s an incredible story behind the albums history, with several documentaries like “Beautiful Dreamer” available that one should really take the time to watch for themselves. As such, I’ll leave that aspect alone.\nAnyway, thanks to members of “The Wondermints” helping Bryan get back on track - particularly Darian Shanana - the 2004 version SMiLE is frankly the most spiritual album your likely to find for miles; the ProTools recording is an audiophiles wet dream with luscious vocal harmonies, wall of sound instrumental arrangements (inclusive of barritone harmonicas) and a brilliant sense of psychedelic humour!\nAs a concept album, there are several elemental themes woven into the albums fabric. For me the water sections transition between “Child is Father of the Man” and “Surfs Up” has a shimmering depth, thanks to the Stockholm Strings and their emotive glissando’s. Theres plenty of substance to the album, just get in for a swim!\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/fatfreddiesdrop/","title":"Fat Freddies Drop","description":null,"body":"Albums: BOATS, Blackbird.\nFunky, dubby, souly, psychedelic goodness from Wellington New Zealand. For those literate enough to read the songlines, there are landscapes packed into BOATS thats brimming with meaning and significance assuming you can feel the soul. The bands first album “Based on a True Story” (aka BOATS) with its acrostically evocative album cover is probably the bands most popular work, although Blackbird has a sense of ratna earthyness that shouldn’t be ignored.\nThe production of both albums are top notch; high quality recordings, strong arrangements, soulful vocals, nuanced and expressive lyrics - vibes all round.\nIf you ask me, pretty much all all the tracks on BOATS are strong, though if you’d like something to illustrate my earlier claims then “Ray Ray” is a good track to try on for size with it’s muted bass lines, sharply polished lazer beam SFX and smooth vocals. For those that enjoy contrast, the pimped out producion of Ray Ray eases off the gas by moving into “Dark Days” which tastes more organic, dynamic and emotive. Let the acoustic, horns, crash and brushed snare sweep you into the ebb and flow of a three four waltz; for me this song really embodies the heart of the psychedelic experience and what it means to be human.\nBlackbird is a different vibe; still distinctly the Drop but the music has a different feel thats murkier and perhaps more magic mushrooms than LSD. The tracks have a looser and more lumpy quality than the ones found on BOATS. The standout track for me on this album is “Mother Mother” due to its exceptionally smooth transition from acoustic band into a more synthy electro pulse before fade out.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/floatingpoint/","title":"Floating Points","description":null,"body":"\n\n\n\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/ghost/","title":"Ghost","description":null,"body":"Albums: Impera, Meliora\nHaving seen the Tobias Forge - Ghosts songwriter - on the covers of numerous music mags over the years I initially dismissed them based on the pantomine image. However, having had many of the music distribution channels force the album Imperala down my throat, I’ve come to realise the genius of this spectacle!\nLyrics sang by front man “Papa Emeratis” - the dark pope - are often a timeless tongue in cheek commentary of empires and the circularity of society and politics. The content is poetic, exceptionally perceptive and often humourous. There are degrees of politcis, while also speaking to the darkness of the marginalised as embodied in the music video “cirice”.\nAll in all their discography is pretty good and singles like “Call me Little Sunshine” are excellent. Theres some serious songwriting chops and a deep craft here; in particular “Spillways” is a stand out composition that comes to mind. There are some more subtle easter eggs of Sabbath, Van Halen and Ozzy riffs if you listen carefully to the arrangements as well - particularly on “Watcher in the Sky”.

Whatever the case it’s well deserved as lyric wise the two MCs are beyond first class wordsmiths. Earlier albums are seemingly less personal and more raw, while later albums are considerably more personal with a pop edge. This is a small price to pay for the added depth and dimensionality and quite frankly the production grows on you.\nWalking Under Stars is probably the darkest period of the bands tenure, with “Live and Let Go” as one of the more profound pieces of lyrical prowess, where guest MC Brother Ali and Pressure drop some lines that are beyond poetic. I’ll not labour how good this group is though, as I’ve a more refined post to drop related to the Hilltop Story.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/justice/","title":"Justice","description":null,"body":"Albums: Woman, HYPERDRAMA\n\nWith dark but colourful aesthetic, the albums Woman and Woman World Wide (its live remix) are a hyperoptimised synthesis of synthesis… oscillating with an impressivly polished sound, the dark saw tooth synths and side chained snares are skillfully blendend with airy pop melodies that seem lush and spacious to the ear.\nThe production is attentive and detailed; if you tune into the warm embrace of the track “Love SOS” you’ll notice a tuned siren which follows the chord progression with a washing white noise generator that laps gently like waves splashing in the background! Everything on this album has a similarly distinct texture which will appeal to folks with a wide musical palette.

Theres a clear tension of unrequited love between the vocalists that seems to build to a breaking point by the third album (they later hooked up and continued as the outfit Ida Mae).\nBoth singers are skilled instrumentalists; Chris Turnpin must have sold his soul to the devil to play guitar in such an authentic manner, while the keyboards have a practiced jazz influence to them (no doubt from a rock school). The rhythm section are arguably there to support the two main stars but they do a professional job, keeping things tight and stylistically appropriate.\nEach album feels pretty complete in it’s own right so it’s perhaps best to think of each as phases of tension, coherent in themselves and in sequence; it was consequentially quite exciting to track the bands career trajectory as it happened in real time - from folk violins to blisteringly heavy rock.\nIf you want to know where to start “Feet Fall Heavy” exhibits the bands best writing across albums, while “Burned in the By &amp; By” was a great Abby Road extra produced at the bands zenith yet sadly never appeared on any album. This is the dial set somewhere in the middle.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/maynardjameskenan/","title":"Maynard James Keenan","description":null,"body":"Bands: Tool, Pusifer, Perfect Circle.\nAlbums: Fear Innoculum, 10,000 Days, Conditions of My Parole, Existential Reckoning, Eat the Elephant,\nMaynard is yet another unrelenting creative, god knows where he gets the energy from but every breath drawn appears to be used towards the creation of something new. From any one of his three bands to his businesses and vineyards. The quality of his output is also extremely high, all the albums listed above sound great and come with all the bells and whistles of premium merch and so forth. A born performer!\nTools last two records are particularly note worthy due to the detailed arrangements and production values. Fear Innoculum in particular has a smooth coalescence that is eloquently whole and complete. If you trace back the bands history it will become quite apparent that this is the finished product; 10,000 days is really strong, though rougher around the edges - as with the albums prior to that. The advantage to these earlier albums however are the esoteric Easter eggs that correlate to fibonnachi ratios, or tracks that can be layered over each other.\nMusically the band is a full package; rhythmically, harmonically, melodically interesting with highly refined messaging. Many of the tracks sound extremely organic due to the odd time signatures like 7/8 or 5/4. This tends to move about as well. Favorite Tool tracks include “Jambi”, “The Pot” and “Vicarious” from 10,000 Days and perhaps “Invincible” or “Decending” from Fear Innoculum though it’s a harder album to pick from due to the self similar cohesiveness of the tracks.\nPuscifer then are another vibe, much less esoteric and more of a comedy show or drama than anything. It’s quite something. You get all sorts of characters and narratives popping out of this setup; seemingly a parody on life, or maybe the three gunas who then give rise to the wheel of samsara. Musically Pusifer are more versitile and experimental than Tool or APC, which has a charming novelty, though at the cost of consistency which is quite honestly advertised as SPAM. Tracks to dig on would be the title track of “Conditions of My Parole”, which is a really solid album with tracks like “Monsoons” “The Weaver”, “Green Valley” and then other tunes like “Bread and Circus” and “Bullet Train to Iowa” from the album Existential Reckoning (#IamTheBriefcase).\nA Perfect Circle are then much closer to Tool than Pusifer. There are a few albums to choose from and they’re all worth a listen, though I’d recommend “Eat the Elephant” as the most mature. In particular the title track stands out as delicate and spacious, while “Disillusioned” has the production, arrangement, lyrics and performance.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/nilerodgers/","title":"Nile Rodgers","description":null,"body":"Albums: Risque, Random Access Memories,\nNile has always churned out hits since the early days of Chic’s “Everybody Dance”, through to Daft Punks “Get Lucky”. What’s most amazing about him is his ability to take complex jazz voicings and create a polished pop masterpiece without a hint of dissonance. Check out his interviews, he’s a wonderful story teller and is living proof that Disco doesn’t suck (though he was somewhat forced into new territories by the movement).\nMyself, I’m a fan of the Chic classics like “Everybody Dance” and “Good times” for the uplifting funk vibes and genere defining style of guitar and bass leading the rhythm section; Bernard Edwards being Niles legendary compatriot on the low end. Absolutely Rocking.\nBesides Chic’s tunes, Nile is pretty much all over the map when it comes to major artists; Madonna, Sister Sledge, Bowie, Duran Duran and so on - though Daft Punk’s last album is for me the most interesting. Of course “Get Lucky” with Pharell Williams was the big splash but “Give Life Back to Music” and “Loose Yourself to Dance” are arguably better pieces of craft.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/robertfripp/","title":"Robert Fripp","description":null,"body":"Albums: In the Court of the Crimson King, Lizard, Red, The Power to Believe\nRobert Fripp of King Crimson is arguably one of the most diciplined musicians out there, practicing six hours a day in order to perform near impossible arrangements like “FracKture” with a triple band lineup consisting of some of the best musicians on the plannet. It’s a pretty impressive lineup!\nThe band made their debut in 1969 with the album “In the Court of The Crimson King” which is their most famous by a long shot - you know, the one with the iconic screaming face. Apparently their first performance of “21st Century Schitzoid Man” in Hyde Park left the audience so disoriented that people forgot to clap the Rolling Stones onto stage!\nFor many years I found “Red” the most appealing album as it feels particularly whole and exhibits some incredible compositions. The album was titled “Red” because the band broke so many formal musical rules that if you submitted it for a music school exam you’d have received the report back full of red crosses. As suggested by such a story, the album breaks boundaries and sounds incredible having been recorded at Air Lyndhurst in London - the studio George Martin (the fifth Beatle) bought and refitted. The tracks “One More Red Nightmare” and “Starless” are in my opinion highlights of the album.\nAnother enthralling album is “The Power to Believe”, which displays quite some virility. It’s a modern album with electronic instruments, bone crushing guitars and some luscious moments of release. The rhythms, textures, compositions and technicality are vital elements of the resultant soundscape. You probably won’t find anything like it anywhere else; incredibly creative and powerful stuff that’s akin to a non-traditional gamelan.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/robertplant/","title":"Robert Plant","description":null,"body":"Album: Mighty Rearranger, Dreamland\nWhile a lot of Robert Plants solo work doesn’t really float my boat, Mighty Rearranger is absolutely fantastic! “Another Tribe” starts the album with a rhythmic vitality that beams sunshine everywhere, which is appropriate given the second track is called “Shine It All Around”. This track is another winner on the production given it’s many layred vocals and huge echo effects on the chorus - hard to believe it was recoded in a small Welsh studio. At the end of the album there’s also a drum and bass remix of this tune which is pretty nice. Roberts not lost his voice or soul even at this stage of his career.\nHonourable mentions as well to the album Dreamland which is also pretty strong; particularly “Darkness, Darkness” and his cover of Dylan’s “One More Cup Of Coffee”. Of course we could add a lot of the Zeppelin stuff here as well but I’m deliberately avoiding review of obvious classics as those trails are known.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/snarkypuppy/","title":"Snarky Puppy","description":null,"body":"Albums: We Like it Here, Family Dinner\nA well composed cosmopolitian fusion of jazz, funk, rock, blues, hip hop, electro and soul.

If your into the instrumental hip hop vibes then “We Like It Here” is a great album - plenty of exotic sun and colourful places to explore. The dirty bass line towards the end of “Shofukan” is worth the wait, with complex textures and rolling soundscapes are on the way towards this distination!\nIf your looking for something more traditional big band, with vocals and such, then start with the album “Family Dinner” instead.

Despite what some might consider to be a vulgar or crass band name, the musics about as as smooth as it gets and also pretty refined. These virtues come courtesy of the well thought out arrangements, the best jazz musicians of the time in some of the best studios. Apparently a descriptive term applied to them by a journalist at one point or another was “Yacht Rock”, which is quite apt!\nIn funny sort of way, Steely Dan are actually kind of like a cynical version of Byran Wilson. The genius is certainly there with their cream of the crop arrangements, artsy lyrics, unusual instruments and so forth - so the real difference is the tone and taste… Dan as you might suspect are less innocent and a dollop more dark.\nAlbum wise the Royal Scam is probably my favourite of the lot, though Aja is one of the most famous.

Besides his main band Porcupine Tree and his solo career, he is also King Crimsons mix and mastering engineer (amongst many other bands, particularly in Prog).\nPorcupine tree has relatively large discography, though generally speaking I’ve found the cream begins to rise from “Fear of a Blank Planet” onwards. This is roughly the period when Gavin Harrison joined the band, who you might recognise as 1/3 of Crimsons Rhythm section; naturally he is one a hell of a drummer.\nGuitars, synths, bass and vocals are all arranged tastefully across Wilsons work too. Things tend to get more jazzy as Porcupine Tree ages, though that’s not to say that C/C is soft by any means. This is evidenced by the extremely gritty telecasters on tracks like “Rats Return” which is a bone crusher of a riff… Not to mention “Herd Culling”.\nTrying out Wilsons solo stuff you’ll find that it’s more eclectic; the Harmony Codex being more electronic in nature though it’s still characteristic of his unique style with complex vocal harmonies and textured layers. The videos are also quite creative, especially the one for his AI generated Christmas song “December Skies” or “Economies of Scale”.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/sturgilsimpson/","title":"Sturgill Simpson","description":null,"body":"Albums: Sailors Guide to Earth, Sound and Fury\nSomething more less jazz you say? Ok, well, Sturgil keeps things safe by keeping to familiar progressions and standard time signatures, though he does a fantastic job of making them interesting. He even recognises and discloses the recursivity of his writing in the lyrics of “All Said and Done”!\n\nKeep staring at the pages, coming up with the same lines,It’s all been said and done by now, two or three times.\n\nThis however is not surprising (as he knows how to wield the pen) because the line is also symbolic of the essence of his breakthrough album which was title called “Meta-modern Sounds in Country Music”. Yep, psychedelic country music. You can’t find a larger market than country music so he pretty much nailed the business strategy for going mainstream! (intentional or otherwise)\nHinted at by the album title “A Sailors Guide to Earth” and reading between the lines of “Welcome to Earth Pollywog” and “Keep Between The Lines” it seems pretty obvious that the albums intended as a time capsule for his newborn child. In particular I’d recommend the track “Brace For Impact” for its lyrics framed by a particularly solid bass line chugging the title into life (what a shaker in the chorus!). The motown vibe throughout this album also has an authenticity to it akin to the Muscle Shoals sound.\nIf your a fan of the Danger Mouse sound (Black Keys), then you’ll appreciate the production of Sound and Fury, which exemplifies the style - for instance painting in the drums of “Best Clock Maker on Mars” which has a precise and unrelenting shuffle. The aesthetic of switching radio stations is pretty creative too and reminds me of Pink Floyds “Wish You Were Here”. Once the blistering guitars get too intense (they do), your treated to some melting moments of release like in the tune “Make Art, Not Friends”; as such I’d suggest sticking with the tension and listening to the album straight through from start to finish… oh and “Remember to Breathe”! ;)\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/music/sylvainrichards20syl/","title":"Sylvain Richards (20SYL)","description":null,"body":"Albums: Tetra, The Upper Hand\nSylvain Richard is the multi-potentiate creator behind Hocus Pocus, C2C, 20syl, Alltta and a number of other artistic endevours.

The tracks have a flavour of funky electronic disco and seems to satisfy most peoples tastes in any group gathering. It also consistently breaks the mould enough for those who desire texture, novelty and refinement in their music.\nRichards other stuff is solid too; most if not all of his productions feel sonically well polished and are often delivered with a simple but well designed and creative video like “Kodema” or “The Beat”. If you want a groove you’ll find that C2C and 20syl has enough rythmic elements churned with modern synthesis to warm up most crowds; for example “Can You Dance To This”?\nSome other hot picks not to miss out on are “Down The Road”, “Back &amp; Forth” and “Le Banquet”.

This is a basic premise upon which we can expand.\nContext\nThe basis for this proposal integrates number of sources, but the synthesis of it is largely non-linear.⁴⁵⁶ So that things are easier to follow and agreeable it’s suggested that we use the laws of harmonious vibration to guide organisational experimentation. If you prefer colour as a medium, your welcome to substitute it for music theory, it’s probably all the same so long as it’s Pythagorean!⁷\nProblem / Driver\nWe need to scale and integrate causes in general for exponential value creation. We also need to shift global patterns from zero-sum games to reciprocal ones or face a planetary lose-lose scenario.⁸ Single organisations often have problems with alignment, let alone extitutions with theoretically infinite stakeholders. How do we create a metastable commons?\nWorking with others generally results in increased focus, information dispersion and output quality. This is by and large the point of organising as a group — to create positive sum returns! Admittedly this doesn’t always work out and group think can create situations that are to the detriment of an individual.\nAs organisations scale, they tend to slowly commit Seppuku by building up an arsenal of complicated processes. The intent is usually to handle a short term problem, but as time marches on they accumulate and the organisation eventually begins to self-suffocate on the bureaucracy… at the point it becomes critical many are already likely to have had enough.\nAs an alternative, we are looking for working patterns that are fluid, self-directing and actualising — while at the same time acknowledging the importance of connection, belonging and working together!\nThis might sound counter intuitive, but paradox it turns out is pretty damn common in nature! To illustrate I suggest trying to describe a fractal — does the opposite word also apply? Cool, so let’s find allegory in the natural to guide our collaboration and elaboration biomimetically!\nProposal\nThe proposal is to base our working patterns in music. In an organisational context, chords become working groups consisting of notes or people that form around a “strange attractor” - before disbanding again towards completion.\nWhen forming the next chord (or working group) its internal makeup should probably retain a good deal of harmonic self-similarity — members ideally remain related to the previous group but not completely identical. The musical example of this relationship is C major and A minor, who’s constituent notes are CEG and ACE — a single note or persons difference.\nPaired programming in this regard can be considered a simple “power chord” or “dyad” where the fundamental note is mutually reinforced by its closest consonant relation or good friend the musical fifth. These notes are indeed mutually reinforcing but may tend to lack meaningful direction in a larger context; they are too similar! At this point we can obtain a gravitational center simply by adding a third person or note to the mix, giving rise to major or minor directionality and enabling the emergence of a minimally coordinated or self-directing group (“triad’).⁹\nChords or groups of higher complexity have lower consonance or alignment initially, but because of the discord they can perhaps be used to navigate complex changes or create stronger resolutions (alignment) within an organisation.\nPractically we might suggest that sounding or gathering all the notes of a given octave might be equivalent to other octaves which would be self-similar and thus a representative sample of the whole. Seven also happens to be the number of neighbors a murmuring starling appears to follow¹⁰ and is often the limit of our own object tracking capabilities for things like phone numbers.¹¹\nI don’t wish to prescribe anything, but perhaps that’s also the limit for making complex decisions?\nPractical steps…\n\nTake it upon oneself to form a power chord (duo) with a friend.\nDecide on a third party who you think can add value to the party in either a major or minor direction. When necessary you may adopt suspensions and other alternate voices, but I’d suggest ideally only when up scaling or changing key.\nAs a trio decide on an activity you think is impactful towards a larger goal and commit to doing the work together.\nWhen the task is complete, two parties continue with a related next step. At the end of group work, decide who this should be but not what to do.\nThe two people/notes continuing the epic, should procure a new third party based on a “strange attractor” otherwise known as alignment to the previously completed work.\nFrom here the newly formed chord can decide on the direction of the next movement.\nScale infinitely.\n\nThe Open Coop were good enough to invite me to a panel discussion as a result of this article so I decided to add it on the end as a thanks:\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Alan Watts Life and Music\n[2] Scale-free correlations in starling flocks\n[3] To be clear pythagorean tuning means that there is no quantisation of the octave which we force upon the instruments we have built with equally tempered tuning, thus octaves are fractal within themselves and do not repeat more than once.

They are an abundance of integrated systems instrumental in the shaping of lightning, galaxies, rivers, mountains and even our own circulatory systems.\nThe term applicable to these patterns is “fractal”; usually taken to mean “non-regular geometric constructs that exhibit the same degree of non-regularity at all scales” — for a visual example, just reference the above picture.\nObserving such, we can see that on one hand fractals probabilistically conform to a larger pattern, while at more granular levels they exhibit seemingly radical levels of non-conformity between each-other — just like grains of sand!\nMeta Patterns\nAs building blocks of practically everything maybe we can consider fractals as a biomimetic meta-pattern:\nLinguistically trying to define them, a phenomena of repeating paradox occurs! Assign a descriptor to one of their displayed attributes (like the “finite” equation below) and the antonym can usually also be applied (as in the “infinite” animation).\nAs fractals are everywhere; contradiction and paradox are thus also present in everything. They are ordered yet chaotic, static yet transformative; a stable open system.\nHere’s a picture based example and more attributes for the same thing:\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps then reality is an integral — a singularity or “whole system” — our experience of separateness is thus potentially an illusory derivative. Taking opposites and appreciating both sides we generate a win-win pluralistic integration, not a zero-sum competition.\n\n\nAttention to quality and quality of attention. Another frame is that we live in an age of digital abundance yet our attention is limited; we should curate how we spend our time — every tangent is a potential vacuum and decisions are fractal chains of causality. Make good decisions - getting closer to nature is about being present while developing a sense of aesthetics in the infinite.\n\n\n\n“Everything in moderation, including moderation!” — Oscar Wilde\n\nPractical applications\n\nA paradoxical statement gifted to me while on my travels was:\n\n“stay with the group on your own trip”.\n\nAn integrative scenario that says a lot. Most endeavors are just “trip” or general abstraction. Since we have everything we need right here, perhaps we should just coordinate, trust and educate each other!\nPersonal, local, global\nGiving up command and control power structures means to reintegrate at the personal level — ourselves, the grass roots — while recognising chains of causality that we are affected by, and put into effect.\nIndividuals form the primitives of the larger group who change and are changed by their context personally, locally and globally — balance in the individual is then probably a first principal towards unlocking scale-free potential. Intentional communities grow through necessary and sufficient action undertaken by the parties involved; without this we get the emergence of interference patterns — by which I mean people and communications start to phase, cancel out and dissipate 😔.\nThis is why attention to quality and quality of attention is important; which essentially translates to creativity so the first script we should be writing is our own — on an iterative cycle! Any pattern we recognise ourselves repeating should be empirically tested for validity — the interoceptive definition of “skin in the game”.\n\nSo the personal level is an intentionally iterative practice at “being human” while integrating a paradox of “holding the tension” into our lives… the difference between where we are and where we want to be. The difference between whats necessary and sufficient. Delta.\n\nLocal then represents a place of contextual immediacy exterior to ourselves — where we are, and the company we are keeping. Raising a forest of knowledge is probably the fastest route towards regenerative change — patterns ripple outward casually which warp the shape of our shared reality. Let’s teach, learn and share!\nThe global scale seems driven by memetic function — ideas are the seeds we propagate into tools and software. Stories and shared knowledge create and coordinate — currency and companies are simply memetic units of account. Bitcoin is a meme.

All, is made up of everything. So, metaphysical semantics aside - lets zoom in and and discuss this at a level of granularity where there’s both an interior and exterior; order and chaos.\nOrder often arises out of a chaotic primordial soup that has enough stored potential for structure to emerge spontaneously. In living systems this is the formation of a cellular membrane who’s metabolism regulates the flow of energy and resources across the boundary. Lets apply this concept to an event.\nThose volunteering and provisioning contributions are self-organising - the interior order. Those attending to consume and appropriate from it are not - the exterior chaos. Provisioners are people with a vested interest in the creation of a result. They invest time, attention and resources into creating and holding a space. Sometimes this is topdown (commercial events), other times its bottom up (emergent events).\nAnti-patterns\nLike #mechanimals, many of us are conditioned to rely on some form of authority that prods and tells us what to do. When it appears that there’s no one to abdicate responsibility to we often implicitly assume that someone else is taking care of things due to the diffusion of responsibility.\n\nThe boss is gone, finally I can sit down!\n\nLack of knowledge or skills is another issue which leads to bottle necks, towers of knowledge and hub and spoke dynamics. Fine for commercial events, but not useful for emergent ones!\n\nWait, uuuum, whats going on again? what can I do? how can I help?\n\nLuckily, events are pretty easy; anyone with 5 neurons (like me) can organise them. You just need an outline of whats needed. So if you want to participate on the below events and wish to help arrange something then just refer to the list below and start coordinating with other participants!\n\nEquinox call\nIn the case of a real self-organising event, everyone participating is accountable and responsible for the groups success or failure. It’s a highest common potential or lowest common denominator situation. To be explicit; accountability is about keeping track of whats going on, while responsibility is about playing our own particular part and filling in the observable blanks.\nSo - for those that wish - let’s practice organising before we converge in person for CCC. The Fall Equinox last year was a pretty strong effort from those involved - especially as a first attempt. Can we pull it off again at the Spring Equinox; March 20th? Can improvements on the last gathering be made this time round? It’s certainly possible if we try.\nGenerative steps\nIn the spirit of accountability/responsibility, below is a list of steps for those who wish to know whats involved in producing such a gathering. I’m assuming a generic event so the structure can be used to plan something physical or digital:\n1) Meta\nMany things will need to be tracked dependent on the format; contributions, workshops, speakers and tasks are good candidates for such. Most of this can be noted in a spreadsheet, but for the things that require articulation in a special format just link to them so they can be easily found by others.\nIt’s perhaps also useful to describe some roles or classes in relation to the event requirements; some will be before the event (copy, propaganda, webdev), others will be during the event (documentation, recording, tech support, facilitation, welcoming committee/representation etc.).\nThese don’t need to be strictly adhered to unless the event is large scale, classes/circles/groups are perhaps more flexible for smaller scales. Ideally people should articulate what they are doing and ‘own’ the task in some transparent way (spreadsheet/document) so that others can get an overview of whats happening and what they can pickup.\n2) Pick a theme &amp; Gather intentions\nSee if people are interested in the event and invite them to contribute. What do they wish to gather around? This can be pretty much any theme. Technologists gather around CCC, Jugglers around the EJC, and festival goers for Burning man.\nFind a strange attractor with some energy that entices contribution. Sometimes it’s a shared interest or intention - other times its a narrative or story.\n3) Time and Place\nThis may seem blindly obvious but a time, date and appropriate venue are fundamental before anything can happen. The digital world is forgivingly flexible so a chat server like Discord or Zoom may suffice. Worth noting at this point is that in person events have a higher bandwidth for communication and are more conductive for transformative experience. Regardless, a space to point at and say something’s happening is necessary. Formalise an invitation!\nPropaganda: Spring Equinox will be here on March the 20th, and CCC will be in Leipzig on the 27th of December.\n4) Commitments\nFoundations in place, it’s time to invite contributions. Those who expressed intentions to help in step 2 are the good people to request commitments from. These can be of all varieties; workshops, talks, games, fishbowl discussions, interactions of any variety really. The more novel, creative and participatory the better! Share the spreadsheet from step 1 and note the contributions people are offering. Ideally theres plenty of slack and notice on the timeline; qualitive contributions need time for both creation and refinement! (*Note the CCC gathering is at year end)\nThe best contributions encompass both the “self” and “organised” facets of self-organisation. The former is relativly straight foward as most people are happy to talk to a crowd of listeners, while the latter is incredibly hard as few people enjoy “sweeping floors” or picking up mundane organisational duties. 🧹If your a janitor, kudos to you! 🧹\n5) Website/Invitations\nThis functions as an instruction manual for the event. It should contain all the things people need to know to onboard. The time/date of the event, the narrative, how to join, rituals and customs, the schedule, how to add a workshop, how the rooms are being organised, how to use a given technology and so on.\nThe website is an invitation for the outside world to initiate themselves into a foreign community. Work these details out, then create something clear and compelling!\n6) Pre-Production\nTypically this is booking stuff like lights, sound, cameras, screens, chairs, tables and catering. If the event is in the real worls, work these details out based on number of attendees starting with whats needed in each room. You can forget most of this if the event is digital, but some form of scheduling is still needed so people can find what they are looking for.\n7) Outreach\nWith an inviting shop front setup, now’s a good time to invite guest speakers and friends. These people won’t necessarily contribute to the organisation sides of things but will hopefully bring a valued perspective and diversity to the gathering. Who’s interesting and might be ready to contribute value? Make a list and contact them. Note any requirements they might also have (see: step 1).\n8) Propaganda\nIf you want the event to be open to the outside world, its a good idea to make some noise. A Twitter account for the event isn’t a bad idea, especially if theres an active community retweeting posts and amplifying eachothers reach. A lot of places use targeted hashtags for this but there are other strategies too like writing blog posts and sharing those in your various channels too (cough ’scuse the spam).\n9) Production mode\nThe event itself will probably need some stewardship. If roles were set up in step one, people can now try them on for size. If not any capable human-doing can still infer what’s needed and try to improvise! Refer to booked resources at step six if the events not digital.\nThere should be a spreadsheet of things happening, timings and so forth available by now, so running the event is just about keeping an eye on the plan. Small deviations can bring an element of suprise and novelty, while large deviations can throw the whole space into confusion. Things always go wrong so just communicate and improvise when they do; the show must go on!\n10) Feedback\nGet feedback through a post-event form or get in contact with attendees and take notes on peoples experience. Use this to fine tune the next event and find out any additional information that may be useful. What worked? What didn’t work?\n11) Packaging artefacts\nAfter the events happened, what can be packaged? Photos, videos, media, discussions, posts, projects, narratives. A lot of energy was just concentrated, you can let it evaporate into the aether or package whatever was shared and sustain momentum. What can be upcycled?\n\nFurther considerations\nSo that’s it on the generic front, but there’s always more detail which depends on context. As such, heres some more nuanced possibilities for self-organising events.\nOnboarding\nAs mentioned, groups have a membrane effect that regulates a flow between the in-group and the out-group. People that fall into the out-group category tend disappear and move on. This is fine to degrees but not in excess - things can easily become an echo chamber of ideology and if so the lack of novelty will eventually extinguish the group.\nA simple solution to incorporate new members is a communal introductory round followed by a more intimate setting, like a 1:1 or small group discussion in a breakout room. Ideally new members get to meet older members who can act as anchors/stewards - from there hopefully people will feel comfortable in the space and the system can self-regulate.\nCommunication\nCommunity arises out of communication, so how skilled a group is at communication determines the cohearence of the room. Most zoom calls are a fuster cluck for this reason.\nBut it doesn’t have to be. Some suggestions:\n\nMute microphones when not talking. This is pretty standard practice already.\nCodify hand signals and watch for them. Super powerful and non disruptive.\nChange up the discussion style with hotseats, fishbowls, popcorn, breathe first.\nLabel breakout rooms and keep renaming them with the current topic.\n\nIf you want to get really detailed, the Gameshifting grammar might be for you!\nClasses\nIf people feel they have a domain of responsibility, they can assume a mandate to act. For an event, here’s a list of potential domains that people may wish to involve themselves with, perhaps taking on more specific roles if the events more complex.\n\nEvent production (operations and organisation)\nTechnical production (audio visual)\nContent development (media and website)\nCommunications and outreach (propaganda and invites)\nSpeakers and workshop facilitators\nDocumentation and copy\nPunters and participants\nHelp, care and support\n\n🧹Sweeping up 🧹\nThats it for now. This post isn’t meant to be all encompassing but if others would like to feedback with thoughts, considerations, missing details and build a more comprehensive manual I’m happy to collaborate on an events gitbook or to recieve feedback. Just ping me on Discord @JoshAFairhead#3602 or via e-mail.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/archive/distributingdigitalidentity/","title":"Distributing Digital Identity","description":null,"body":"\n\nIf I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on the solution, I would spend the first 55 minutes determining the proper question to ask, for once I know the proper question, I could solve the problem in less than five minutes,”‌\n— Albert Einstein.\n\nThis article is a process of my thoughts in motion in search of a question. If you just want the takeaways, they can be found in the conclusion. Now, onward!\n‌\n‌\nFusion\nIdentity might be considered an intractable or wicked problem simply because the number of thoroughly entangled belief systems, and conflicting world views, are in a deep state of cognitive fusion. Simply summarised as:\n\n“Trying to define yourself is like trying to bite your own teeth.”‌\n― Alan Watts\n\nThere’s a whole-part relationship. To untangle the messy whole we should first gather the overarching perspectives and differentiate the parts. Once these assumptions have been distinguished, we can begin to reassemble and integrate them into something meaningful.\nDifferentiation\n\n‌\nHave you ever wondered why we all think and behave so differently? The question has bothered me for many years. It’s seems that there are two major principals drive this phenomena; structural coupling and inheritance.\nBoth are immediacy biases where our cultural and historical contexts shape our world view. Unconsciously we assume that our lived experience is actually representative of reality, and then extrapolate from there. But:\n\nThe map is not the terrain, and the menu is not the meal.\n\nLet’s zoom out and make some sweeping generalisations about our cultural, and linguistic frames - for now we can group them as follows:\nNatural Identity: Interior Bias\nEastern countries and Indigenous cultures often speak in the form of verbs where context is inferred. In Japanese, “Hungry” can either mean that the subject is hungry, or it can represent a question about another’s state.\nWe might say this is a subjective form of identity; it’s interdependent, networked, ephemeral, and probabilistic. It’s an identity in motion like a stream flexing to the course of life. It’s provenance; an origin of recursive depth or the Tao which cannot be named. It’s an emerging whole.\n\nKey words: Verbs, Subjects, Networks, Edges, Feminine.\n\nLegal Identity: Exterior Bias\nWestern countries generally tend to hold a more noun like paradigm. Typically, we have a more materialistic perspective where statements like “tell the truth” are made as if such an abstraction is real or objective. This is possibly because we tend to view the world through a reductionist lens of atomistic parts.\nWe might say this is an objective form of identity; it’s a concrete topology that’s structured, deterministic and noun like. It’s an identifier; a barcode, passport number or record stored in a database. It’s a verified credential. Such data is excellent for administration and tracking for better or worse.*\n\nKey words: Nouns, Objects, Structures, Vertices, Masculine.\n\nPart-whole relationship\nAs previously mentioned, the part-whole relationship is also worth noting. Again, these are heuristics inherited from our cultural and historical context. Broadly generalised; western countries tend to hold a more individualistic frame, while eastern countries often have a more pluralistic view of things.\nHowever, both polarities fail to account for scale and levels of abstraction — a human entity can be regarded as a consortia of bacteria, as a single person, or as part of a larger group. As such, when we discuss identity it would be wise to scope the context or we might easily end up confused.\n‌\n‌\nIt’s political\nSo, it should now be clear that identity is about how individuals and groups, interpret, anticipate and interact with the world. This is known as ontology, and for the most part our heuristics are skewed one way or another.\nWith 7.8 billion people on the planet — and infinitely more contexts to interact with — we are entering into the unpredictable territory of complexity and chaos. To be explicit; I’m suggesting that identity is inherently political. So, how can we moderate the middle?\n\n‌\nAs feedback loops are erratic and invisible, the regulation of such a system must embrace the law of unintended consequences. Risk mitigation and strategic intervention is the name of the game!\nCurrently SSI falls into the category of complexity, as we are not in a modality of disaster mitigation just yet. However given the potential for it to all set fire and become a 1984 dystopia, we should regulate for chaos.\nHow?\nStart by observing the current system and by defining the ‘steady state’ as a measurable output indicative of normal behavior. Relating this to e-ID systems that are already in place such as the Dutch DigiD card, we might measure the use of existing functionalities and proofs.\nWe can then hypothesise that this ‘steady state’ behavior should continue in both an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group in this case might take the form of an SSI sandbox to re-implement various functionalities or proofs that are already in use. One thing to note here is that due to the principals of computational irreducibility and variety matching, a sandbox can only disprove a given hypothesis and control the blast radius if it goes wrong.\nNext, variables representative of real world events should be introduced to disrupt the intended behavior and try to disprove our original hypothesis. For identity solutions this might manifest in the form of social engineering, cyber attacks or deviations in functionality not present in the already existing infrastructure.\nIf the sandboxed hypothesis successfully holds up, then it can be released into production and tested in the wild. However, due to the asymmetric risk of implementing such technology, consumer reporting mechanisms should be put in place and monitored with exceptionally tight feedback loops.\nAs digital identity scales to reach mass adoption, not just nationally but internationally, we may very well need to deal with chaos. Top down monitoring and regulation will not be sufficient. When something goes wrong, local actors need to be empowered to take action:\n\nWhat additional conclusions can be made from the recognition of human civilization as a complex organism? Given the complexity of its behavior, it is necessary to conclude self-consistently that as individuals we are unable to understand it, even though we comprise it as a collective. Therefore, one would be unwise to argue, on the basis of general considerations, matters of social policy. Social policy questions must be dealt with by the system, by the people involved, as direct challenges to the system. — “Complexity Rising”\n\nThus, regulation dealing with digital identity needs to evolve. People need to be able to directly challenge the system, with minimal friction to implementation. Luckily we’re entering into a world where open source infrastructure has the potential to remove a lot of existing barriers.\nGranted most citizens are not developers, but a repo is vastly more accessible than parliament — and with the evolution of low/no code environments it wont be long before the average citizen can directly affect changes.\nThese trends take us into the realm of open source governance. How should such open infrastructure governed? One of the more interesting, successful, and explicit protocols is the Collective Code Construction Contract by written Peter Hintjens and the ZeroMQ community. His reasoning for various sections are also well documented here. If such a process was recognised and given flexibility to evolve locally, it would allow citizens to resolve their own problems locally - mitigating asymmetric risk.\n‌\n‌\nConclusion\nThe topic of Identity is incredibly complex and our ontologies are heuristically skewed. Framing the problem appropriately allows us to orient ourselves and avoid bias, but the real challenge is governance and risk management.\nGovernance around this kind of socio-technology must be bottom up as we need to be able to directly challenge the system, rather than relying on third party institutions. This is because representative democracy is too slow and detached to account for feedback loops at the local level. Thus the major question is how to implement effective governance protocols for open source projects?\nNB: The Dutch National Inspectorate of Population Registrars was responsible for the greatest percentage of deaths of any country under Nazi occupation.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/archive/historicallacrymology/","title":"Historical Lacrymology","description":null,"body":"\nWhat the hell has been going on?

The Vogons having obliterated the Empire on Trantor for their intergalactic space highway have begun to homestead the noosphere with myths, narratives, rhetoric and propaganda - essentially entrainment through habit loops. This was nothing particularly new to Hardin, mayor of Terminus, as he knew the empire was both hyparchic and hyperstitious.\nThat’s not to say that Hardin himself was indifferent; there was a delicate balance to be struck between these terms. He of course recognised that the galactic empire and its colonies were real in so far as fictions go and that it was a game of preferences about what ought to be… values.\nThe empire in this respect was just another form of state craft; participatory repatterining thorough contextualised interactions formative of a galactic culture. Hardins concern was not one ideology in particular, it was the harmonious balance and blend of a cross cultural narrative propagated through technology, trade routes and intergalactic songlines…\n\nImpulses travel, that’s just the way the cosmos works, and in Hardins view the empire was just another process of events unfolding. The real quandary lay around cause, contingency and continuation; what was said or done, what was not said or done, by whom and why?\nAll essential interactions had values, meaning and purpose and it seemed there was a spectrum here that rested between facts and values. The Empire too could be seen through such a lens; it was neither good nor evil but an interplay of forces balanced to shape history in an ever expanding cyclical process… naturally a diplomat would take such a view and from experience he knew it was well justified.\nTerminus, Hardins home planet, while technically a subsidiary of the empire remained autonomous in its own right. While weak in terms of military power the foundation had made some major scientific advances, which it used to empower surrounding zones as its infrastructure became increasingly critical.\nThis growing asymmetry did not sit well with surrounding planets, with several of the more powerful systems deciding to launch a 51% attack on Terminus. Realizing the political contortions necessary, Hardin puts forth plans for the ‘Terminus Treaty’ a coalition whereby the hash power of impending zones was at last directed into alignment. The interplanetary validators set to prosper; they themselves eventually becoming political representatives and diplomats of Terminus.\nMallow was one such trader who seemed naturally adept at moving between the planets offering deals and terms on Terminus’ behalf. In doing so he was able to broker peace and secure substantial trade agreements inorder to maintain their sentient impact commons. This delicate balance of power kept Terminus safe from assault while enabling Mallow to focus on developing the planet’s technological capabilities.\nOnce again the asymmetry unsettled some of Trantors military class who noticed and perceived it as a growing threat to the empires stability. Terminus had not defected from the empire but the planets growing technological and economic advantages stirred enough envy to move the more barbaric generals into advance.\nLuckily, the emperor inferring ulterior motives of these agents grew suspicious of the insubordination and put an end to the assault. This intervention however lead to major struggles, conflict and eventually civil war on Trantor as well as the empires eventual demise.\nAbout a century or so later emerged a dark empath known as the mule; a mutant leveraging relational capabilities to form bonds with nearby zones and subsystems as a means of spreading their anguish to those neighbouring Terminus.\nContinuing to believe in the enevitabily of a second empire, the foundation begins to decay in complacentcy only to miss the mules game. The provincial outer planets belonging to the traders begin to grow weary of these politics and eventually plan a revolt in frustration. As the mule launches his attack to plunder the remains of Terminus, the foundation, like Trantor falls. This was NOT forseen in the Seldon plans.\nAs the anastrophe unfolds a number of brave citizens make off in the turmoil to seek out the second foundation. Finding them would not be easy however as they were long underground with essentially zero knowledge of activities in about a centuary; a ghost living on in the memories of those that familiar with the empires troubled history.\nThis point of hazard haunted the mule in their persuit of galactic dominance…\n“Damn these hitchhikers operating under cover of a stealthy new moon; you won’t be able to hide forever!! “\nThe light shone brighter.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/archive/thefoundations/","title":"The Foundation(s)","description":null,"body":"\nDamn the solar punks aren’t gonna like this, but at the height of the cosmic empires prosperity, there were predictions made; A dark age of either 10,000 or 100,000 years.

Applying some studio magick, and psychohistory it may even be possible to squeeze the dark ages down to 10,000 days if lucky.\nThis period seems characterised by a dark magician who wrote the law; it read: ‘do as thou will shall be the whole of the law; love under will’. The affirmation made sense somehow but the questions remained; whos Will? And what of love? Now that the sun has set on Trantor, Terminus will need help in keeping the more barbarous planets from invading. It is at this point that the merchants and mercenaries begin to shine; maintaining law and order while modulating vital flows in the wider cosmic ecology. Grace for Terminus; love under Will.\nThe foundations science of psychohistory enabled Terminus to slowly rekindle a flame in the Cosm0s; bringing hope and new technologies to the nearby planets. Of course many of these were barbarous and liable to weaponise the tech, so Terminus kept certain elements of their stack a secret; instilling a class of twelve butterflys to coordinate connections between the closest 144 planets. Slowly these pollinators grew a cosmic ecology; a sprawling forest of trade routes ferrying nutrients and nourishment to the edges of the galaxy to raise capacity and realise untapped potentials.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/archive/hormesis/","title":"Hormesis","description":null,"body":"Hyper-sanity\nThe general hypothesis was that by descending into madness and emerging, the scope and range of normal perception is pushed creating a new state of normal - one without the self deception, stress, anxiety and myopic world view that has become the average existential condition. This is what drove Jung to write his best work as well as Robert Piersig.\nPushing the threshold\nSo in my opinion this hypothesis makes sense, but in regards to world view it’s a single vertical. That is to say that the mechanism applies to living systems across the board due to the property of metabolism:\nMetabolism\nThe flow of energy and resources across a membrane. The wider the “scope and range” the more resilient the organism. Sounds like the hyper sanity example above right? It probably is, and we can reframe it countless times to see the effect in action. Let’s do so:\nExercise\nThis is the most common example of hormesis. Go to the gym, stress your system with some anaerobic exercise and then rest. When recovered go back and do a little more, this is how you get stronger.\nDiet\nIntermittent fasting is a favourite of the health hackers. Same principal; don’t eat most of the time which lightly stresses your system, then eat during a short window — repeat.\nFinance\nThis ones perhaps less obvious but those of us that were around for various financial booms like the dot com bubble or the ICO rush of 2017 seem to have a pretty different take on money. It went up, pushed the threshold, then went down. As a result many people experienced a mental shift in how they think about units of account… and generally seem more financially resilient than your average Joe in retail.\nReading\nHave a go at reading at with Accelareader and note the base rate your comfortable starting with. Turn up the word count until you can no longer keep up, back off just a bit and read for a while at a higher speed. Return to your base rate — does it seem a bit slow all of a sudden?\nJuggling\nI’m a juggler and have been since a teenager. One of the things I noticed when I started juggling five balls was how much more accurate I was with three having learned to work at a faster pace.\nDriving\nEver been driving on a highway and then turned off into a town? Dropping a couple of gears just like the previous two examples — everything suddenly feels super slow. Your threshold has shifted!\nIce baths\nThat ever famous dutch man again! Well, the benefits of these have been talked about a million times; while no expert my simple guess is that the extremes are pushing the threshold once again.

You’ll find it across all sorts of realms like muscle or eye sight rehabilitation, inoculation and immunity in medicine and probably thousands of other places.

The warm greetings turn into priming for the week and in comes the Sunday shock to clear some space for the rest of the week; an aggressive disregard of concepts lacking an agreed upon convention.\nThis change of temperature felt a little shocking but foundational context was getting set; we know only what we’ve been informed of and frankly much of that is nonsense. Josh demolishes any remotely abstract ideas that surface and proceeds to inform us about linguistic systems; the etymology and origins of the grammar we were using etc. - old territory for myself and Ome but foundational stuff. We retire for bed at around 1am on these notes.\nYou might say that Monday was largely an ‘informal practice’ of confronting Josh and trying to defend our ignorance - all the while being blatantly told of his meta-game (“domination”) and the playing field (“with words I create”). This is largely apparent to me, so I take a back seat in order learn from the interactions of others attempting to share opinions and information… and Josh’s vigilant rebuttal of their predications!\nThe style was certainly argumentative, but he gesture, form and delivery were all pretty considerate; in case we were to forget the game Josh was repeatedly informing us that words are tools and the intention behind their use is what really matters… don’t bloody forget, its important!\nThroughout the game he would often explicate things like “I’m the emperor wearing no clothes” or “I’m overtly playing in the mud to demonstrate what your up against in this world”, just in case there was any confusion around motives… which of course happened at times!\nDespite these paradoxes, I found Josh pretty congruent in enacting his philosophy and despite his unrelenting ‘attacks’ on unsubstantiated opinion, the gestures made were consistently kind hearted. What a brilliantly controversial character! Heresy!\nWe spent most of this first day in discussion while moving between various locations in the grounds (coffee, lunch, walks etc.). Like the night before he was  trying to set foundational context about knowledge itself, for the sake of convention… Metalinguistics right?\n\n\n\nWhile sitting for coffee we encapsulated “what knowledge is” as five categories; synthesised information that is:\n\nFor me this definition validated well through the geometric epistemology I use for ‘cognitive security’. The same can be said regarding a ‘dispute of predication’:\n\nThe conversation then turns to understanding; for which Josh provides a triad of triads to outline the dynamics:\n\n\n\nQuite a deal was transmitted through our interactions and there were many gems; philosophical fragments of all sorts. Our conversation on knowledge and understanding moves us on to the study of deontology;\nThe Deontic square being:\n\nThe Deontic Star of:\n\n\nDeitic reference (here / now)\nMessage (poetics)\nChannel (phatic function)\nCode (meta linguistic)\nSpeaker (Locutory expressive/denotive function)\nReciever (connotive function)\n\nTypes of reasoning:\n\nCognitive progression:\n\nLater on in the evening Moritz arrives from the airport just in time for dinner, Yada after just having picked him up; he seems a bit apprehensive so Josh greets him with an introductory statement along the lines “you look tense, is everything ok?”. There’s a little dance of getting to know each other for a bit and to my senses Moritz feels cautious of the scenario, choosing to remain aloof while hanging back on his chair but they are both civil and accommodating.\nTuesday feels like there’s a degree of polarity in the air; Ome’s working most of the day, Moritz is on the couch next to him making use of his phone, Eva has occupied herself cooking lunch, while myself and Pekko dig around in a number of subjects like technology, morality, eschatology, ontology, definitions, semiotics and so on. - yes I’m defending a hopeful future of the third horizon.\nAfter lunch we head for a brief walk down to the church before returning to the porch for coffee in order to continue our discussions. Somewhere along the line a confrontation between Moritz and Josh emerges; for the former it’s an attempt at heart to heart interaction, for the latter it’s a demonstrative opportunity…\n\nMoritz seems to want to build personal rapport before a meaningful engagement with Josh can emerge, but the latter playing things pretty formally. Without this foundational rapport Moritz fells unwilling to be led (or spoken over) and decides it’s time to try a new approach. Josh on the other hand is also unwilling to let anyone lead the conversation or be spoken over and consequently the pair get quite animated as they spar for their preferential operating conditions!\nThis uncompromising interaction is fascinating; as shits hitting the fan, I’m busy contemplating a mnemonic of the five speech acts that myself and Ome previously learnt from Josh on a prior visit (thumb: affirmation, index: accusation, middle: demonstration, ring: declaration and pinky: commisives). I practice identifying these modalities in real time and signal my interpretation to Ome with hand gestures - though he’s unfortunately forgotten the learnt convention. As far as I can tell Moritz seems primarily in the accusative and declarative modalities; while Josh seems deeply engaged in enacting the demonstrative modality…\n\nThis act builds into utter absurdity by the time Josh gets round to addressing egoic drivers (which may or may not have originated from an accusation); by loudly assuring Moritz “my ego is bigger than yours” and repeating “MY EGO IS BIGGER THAN YOURS” in response to any interjections…\nThis leads to them both standing up and Josh gently demonstrates an energy exchange - ‘the action, passion and force’ - on Moritz’s person… before reassuring that “It’s all love Moritz, look it’s all love, I mean you no harm” and showering him with hugs in the process.\nThis switch of modality (into comissives) diffuses the situation as no one can take the interaction seriously at this point, they both sit down again and we continue with relatively peaceful interactions as Ome and Eva head off for a walk.\nMy theory is that this exceptionally odd dance was an opportunity for embodied demonstration; movement from patterning into potential for the purpose of retro-causal theoretical dissection. My own speculations aside, this is the first triad which landed in my notes directly after; assumedly related to the field of ‘Pragmatics’:\n\nRelated to the demonstration followed the dyadic articulation ‘Energy’:\n\nFollowed by the triad of Transitive energy:\n\nAnd Intransitive energy:\n\nFrom the subject of energy we then moved into Rhetoric:\n\n\nEssence: Convincing through the senses.\nExistence: Convincing through reason.\n\nThe three branches of Rhetoric being:\n\nThe dynamics of these branches being:\n\nAnd the Rhetorical field of action being:\n\nLater in the evening Josh recommends we take a break from discussion and watch something together on the porch; “a brave new world” by Ardous Huxley… This is far more entertaining than expected and seems to have a number of pretty cynical undertones to it; though it would seem that Huxley was seeing pretty clearly having cleansed his ‘doors of perception’.\nAbout a third of the way through the film Josh suggests we turn the movie off. I’m pretty engaged with it but others apparently less so; I can sense that something’s brewing just before Moritz decides to share some videos he sent me before.\nHaving already seen these videos and noting a glimmer in Josh’s eyes, I decide to get the hell out of dodge. Yep, further confrontations; these offerings are nonsense, bullshit and ideological etc. - Josh is generally poking Moritz to defend his subjective sensibilities. I’ve died on this front line a few times already so I let the demonstration play out by walking off to throw sticks for the dog’s… who are barking at a hedgehog.\nWednesday we hang out around our breakfast table sharing a little about our various backgrounds before heading over for lunch with Josh and Yada at around 2pm. Eva and Yada have done all the cooking thus far so I offer to throw a quick pasta salad together and let them chill out while others also tend to their devices. Josh and Yada have already eaten and the former is looking rather tired today which enables us to continue at a more chilled out pace.\n\nThere’s enough of a breather for me to hang out on the couch for a bit, so I take the time to frame the eight attributes of ontology in an octad; a real diamond in the rough! According to Josh, the eight components of ontology that are covalent and coexistent ‘en sino’ (at once) are:\n\nHaving taken a brief walk down to the church and back, I show him the mandala over coffee; which brings us into other related fragments - the correspondence between predication and attribution, and further linking back to the triad of quality, quantity and modality.\nFrom here we get into epistemology a little; the correspondence between reason and judgement, and the triad of deductive, inductive and adductive reasoning and so forth; yes - a systematic set is really starting to emerge!\nBefore I could figure out the full systematics of these topics however, we’d switched to reasoning and the “six types of question”; I’m not actually sure that “types” was accurate terminology as they were more “genus” but the hexadic geometry held together reasonably well:\n\nNext to this is an already known pentad of questions; which seem more appropriately termed as “species” (for whom being the predicate):\n\nThe conversation was fragmented, so we move on to Truth as the triad of:\n\nMy notes indicate that we briefly moved back to deictics for a moment before traversing the conversational graph onwards; in particular Josh took a moment to explain the following triad of “speech acts”:\n\n\nLocutionary (physical and grammatical aspects that convey literal meaning)\nIllocutionary (communicative function concerned with speakers purpose)\nPerlocutionary (impact, effect or outcome of speakers words on audience)\n\nBefore we moved back to reason or “where are you coming from?”:\n\nUsually constructed through logical syllogism:\n\nAt this juncture I notice a possible link between syllogism usually being a form of deductive reason - though it seems that there can be six permutations of a syllogisms layout - which opens up an interesting space for exploration.\nFor instance does the order of conclusion, minor, major result in abductive reasoning? I’ll need to do some experiments to determine the implications… but I can imagine that starting with a conclusion, arguing a minor and ending on the major may well correlate with ‘absurdist’ reasoning…\nThe last triad of the day sees to be around etymology; prefix (head), radicle (body), and suffix (tail). I’m not entirely sure how this fitted in with the conversation but is still good to know. This is actually the last set of records in my notebook, though there were many more discussions and interactions centred around previously covered material.\n\nI seem to remember Thursday being a fairly calm day with Josh and Yada turning up at our place in the afternoon for lunch before taking Moritz to the airport.\nDuring a coffee session conversation turns to the term ‘love’. Josh exclaims “Love; oh, don’t get me started on THAT word - the use of the term is so wide that it encompasses the entire fucking universe”… though this aligns with his philosophy regarding the use of words to alter reality, it’s somewhat telling that his dog is called “Eros”.\nWhile he’s driving the point home I add some more controversy to the mix; that ‘love’ and ‘narcissism’ are two sides of the same coin. The former being open and free, the latter being a possessive or expectant variety.\nOn Friday, Yada is kind enough to lend us their car for a group excursion and we head into Olbia town for dinner together. Parking is quite the difficulty as there are many hungry drivers in search of a space; sharks cruising around the lot, cutting in on each other and blocking out spots as they become available. The locals have quite the plurality of parking strategies!\nWe return their car on Saturday afternoon, before having lunch together in the hosting space which is to be followed by a loooooong walk up the mountain. I’m offered an LSD cookie but once again psychedelics are not calling me despite everyone else indulging; I’m becoming quite the trip sitter!\nThis hike up the mountains leads us through all kinds of beautiful scenery, stopping at an old church ground before continuing up to the pinnacle our journeys most aesthetic view. Returning down the mountain (much quicker than when we climbed) we pass Yada in the car who’s off to get some of the tastiest potatoes I’ve ever eaten and some pizza as additional nourishment.\n\n\n\nJosh shares a recording called the ‘Art of Fugue’ over dinner which opens the door for a youtube music night; theres a journey through some gospel music with the same chord progression as ‘Up on Cripple Creek’ by The Band, ‘Sympathy for the Devil’, ‘Man of Constant Sorrow’, ‘Father Son’ by Cat Stevens, and so on - theres even a bit of dancing!\nBefore leaving for the evening Josh wishes to demonstrate his metagame one last time via the analogy of pool; thinking ahead about positioning seemed to be the main point but also other players / balls blocking the way, spin and how quantity effects quality.\n\n\n\nThe next morning, we’re picked up around 12am and Pekko’s delivered with verbal shock about an hour before he’s taken to the Airport; Eva goes along as well to say goodbye as they seem to have become pretty close. The rest of us take it slow for the day and chill out - including Eva upon her return.\nJosh seems to be celebrating a ‘perfect game’, an inference indicated by the classical music and fresh white shirt, worn as if to imply that he “played in the muck and didn’t even get dirty”!\nAfter Pekko and Eva depart, Ome leaves for a solitary wander while I continue to quiz Josh on various points that arose over the week in order to fill in any blanks. Eva returns and sits with us, at some point informs me that I’m “doing great”… possibly because my interactions with Josh are nearly entirely non-adverserial (so somewhat exceptional) and have lead to some reasonably constructive conversation!\nOme comes back from his walk before heading for another with Eva as I hang back with Josh and smoke some CBD he kindly offers. This is the first time we’re actually alone together which is a shift from previous days; theres a sense of relaxation to our conversation - probably he’s also let go of teacher mode and I’m acting pretty parsimonious with my words.\nThere’s a stillness between us which seems to make him slightly uncomfortable or perhaps even slightly anxious. He brings me in to watch some videos from a channel called “Babylon decoded” which is hosted by a pretty authentic Swiss Rastafarian. Conversation has moved into a more personal modality and I sense some concern about the world his daughter is embedded in so reassure Josh that there is still plenty of hope in the present moment; despite a mess the might appear pretty intractable!\nOme and Eva return and we take the latter to the ferry; I stretch out from all the sitting while goodbyes are shared. After this we walk around Olbia for some people watching and a tour of social hotspots. We stop for drinks and pizza at the spot where Josh and Yada met before returning for the night; our AirBnB is gone at this point, along with the others so myself and Ome are permitted to stay in the guest house.\nThe next morning we wake up for coffee and some final conversation before Josh and Yada drop us at the airport. I give them both hugs and before a depart by blowing a raspberry; a convention he joked about several times during the week - addios amigo, the lessons are much appreciated!\nFinally, before taking off, myself and Ome share a few minutes of retrospective before he leaves through security and I search out some food to “fill a gap”. It’s a long travel home via Tolouse and I land back in Lisbon around midnight, grateful to stop traveling at long last!\nHere ends the adventures of 2023!\n\nOnwards,\nAd Astra! ✨\nGallery of Faces:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/travel/austria/","title":"Austria: Crypto Commons Gathering","description":null,"body":"\nGetting to Austria is relatively relaxed; as I’m flying out of Pula Airport. I get an influx of messages from Moritz which internally liquidates some kind of blockage while I queue for security. Landing pretty late, I grab a hostel for the night and then move onward to the Commons Hub via public transport in the morning.\nWalking to the hub I’m surrounded by beautifully tranquil rivers, meadows and mountains. I’m early for the conference by a few days, along with a few others so we spend the week getting to know each other juggling with various chores. Slowly other participants begin to trickle in for the gathering; a number of whom are relatively known from my various travels over the years.\n\nAs I settle in, the first person I speak with is Jelle; he’s interested in all kinds of things and asks for thoughts on the connectivity of his home studio setup. After dinner in the evening he’s discussing applied category theory with some others which I dial into. Eventually I ask if he’s talking about Statebox and it turns out he’s the progenitor; he begins to inform me of the beautifully complex theoretical underpinnings as well as some of the more metaphysical implications.\nAfter discussing various wisdom and magical traditions with Jerome (I think Bhuddism was the trigger); I asked him about his more cosmic role in things and what brought him to this space. His answer was “vision, but not in an egoic kinda way - I don’t really talk about it much but ideas arrive in my head fully formed and then I only need to articulate and express them… I’m a game designer by trade”.\n“Woah, that’s a pretty interesting sense gate you’ve activated; I’m somewhat aphantasic myself - would you mind telling me more? Do you have any recollection of when or how this gate might have opened for you?” we sit down and begin to scratch these depths.\n“yes, I think it happened somewhere around age five; my parents had split up and I found myself sitting on a fence asking ‘what happened before this?’ answering myself and then - like a five year old does - asking ‘what happened before that?’ over and over again… Eventually I reached the point of ‘I guess I was born… so what happened before that?’ at which point I began to imagine what I must assume to be previous lives”.\nWow, if this ‘tracing the source’ was not fascinating enough, he goes on to say that this type of phenomenological experience didn’t resurface for a while until he was about age eighteen. He was apparently drinking with his buddies sate into the night, while also cleaning up his act and getting into meditation. Sleepless from an all nighter he found himself struggling to stay awake during meditation until something snapped, at which point a clear energy suddenly filled him - not unlike what’s been said to happen in formal Sesshin - after which he immediately drove home and had an out of body experience while lying on the couch.\nLying there he realised an ability to zoom in on a corner of the roof. Deciding to test this phenomena further he found was also able to zoom in on the opposite corner.  The perspective however was directly parallel to the first corner which should have been hypothenuse from his position on the couch…\n“I wonder if I can look at myself?” “turning round, I see myself down below lying on the couch”. “At this point I realise I’m having an out of body experience and bewildered with awe, I decide to see if I can see out the window. I move towards the shutters to peer out where I can see the lawn and all the people moving about in the street”.\n“At this point I turn round and head back to my body, unsure if I can actually get back in or how to do that. Reentry is like pushing through a membrane after which I wake up and the phones ringing. Picking up the phone I say ‘you wont believe what just happened to me Margret’, who responds ‘how did you know it was me calling?’ as I’d just picked up the phone!”.\n“I kept this experience to myself until later in life as it was pretty strange to talk about. When having dinner with my aunt and uncle, my aunt started telling us about her out of body experience and so I shared mine from back when I was eighteen. My uncle didn’t know what to say when we finished and it was about this point that the visions started to come back again”. Dinner is served so we hop outside - what a frigging story!\n\nMy room mate Josh “the blockchain socialist”, is delightfully serendipitous in his sleep - randomly exclaiming comments like “oh no, not again!” once a night before settling back into his dreams. In the mornings he has no memory of the imaginal landscapes he’s traversing but we get a laugh from the breath of possible speculations.\n\nNew people are arriving for the gathering the meme pool gets richer and richer; folks like Orion bringing the history of computation and interaction design and others like Daniel and Jorge bringing the philosophies and learnings of ECSA (Economic Space Agency). My dear friend Ome arrives, as do Art, Moritz and some of the Olbia contingent.\nJelle is going full Richard Feynmann with us; mathematically encoding my triads in a matrix and explaining topology - or more appropriately - the end of topology to us…\nHere’s my recollection: topology begins with a point, which has no length breath or depth - infinity as emptiness - and turns into a line or vector between two points. The line then turns into two dimensional planes by connecting a third point, from which we can break out a dimension by joining edges.\nIf we do this with a square it turns into a cylinder, and by inverting the edge connectivity we get a mobius strip. Adding another dimension to the mobius strip we get a Klein bottle - which we can also somehow fold to create a special kind of half sphere, that can also be paired with another to create a full sphere. Theres a problem to note with infinitely thin slices, but from here we can select two points on the surface of the sphere to get ‘the line of infinite projection’.\nAs the distance between points on the line of infinite projection get closer to each other they become whats called ‘the single point of compactification’; a sort of infinite fullness thats a point with infinite length, breath and depth - is where the field essentially ends. Mind blowing stuff, kinda like the mathmatical recipe of god; a theme that would recur over the week.\n\n\n\nSuch theme kept coming back predominantly due to Lio’s love of philosophy - in particular Hagel, encoded as a game he was calling ‘play’. Access to this game was through a deeply codified ChatGPT prompt about interfacing interfaces that change their shape from interfacing with each other. This prompt was a pretty potent brew for generating poetics and led to a number of fun GPT inquiries around the shape of shapelessness or the shape of all shapes, or perhaps even metatrons cube - idk, but it was fun.\nOther memories include a glorious massage circle that Shannon and Noemi started, which seemed to grow exponentially as people happened across it. I got pretty lucky as I initially had Shannon behind me who was intuitively zoning in on trigger points that needed some soft tissue work, after which I got Orion, a human power house to crush the knots in my middle back. If memory serves me well, there was a decent dance session to shake ourselves out again in the conference room initiated by Ome.\n\n\n\nTraversing the weeks more structured sessions were workshops by Matt Slatts on ‘money’ and Art Brock on ‘currencies’, both of which provided a lot of structured information for systematically encoding as knowledge in my notebook. Matt’s contribution was a week long course funded as an ECSA performance, while Arts workshops were more thematically in line with methods of ‘Agile Learning’ and so he tailored his talks to the audience in attendance. The latter had many beautiful diagrams of his own to draw on as content; which I compressed and codified for myself through the lens of General Systematics (see bottom of page for original slides):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe evenings were always eventful; one that comes to mind being the cybernetics ‘movie night’ presenting Cybersyn2023 and some other loosely related productions from Youtube. I’d already seen Cybersyn at Metaphorum but found it too dense for a single viewing so was only too happy that it came round again. The other screenings felt like memetically troublesome info-hazards; propaganda and subliminal brainwashing - highly salient computer graphics, strobe effects and other means of messaging that spike neural energy to create associations and indoctrinate the viewer with memetic ideologies. I quietly drew a pentad encoding the VSM on the flip chart for anyone interested and went outside.\n  \n\nThe events close was another interesting evening which came plenty of eventuality; most people were swaying so after a jam session kicking off some rythmic chaos, I decided to drift around the hub to see what was happening. Ome and Orion were into the AI eschatology discussing prompt injection and the implications of a post truth internet on society; ultimately demanding provenience tracking and encryption extended as deep as the hardware level and possibly beyond.\nWhile sitting outside around the fire with Lio and GPT, ‘the green dot’ (a (LARP or psyop) wandered over and sat down with us. Those mimetically infected by the game were assuming tribal factions based on a sticker and then role playing the conflict into existence… or at least thats what seemed to be going on to those situated outside the memetic bubble. On that note don’t get me started on ‘the bubbles’! (iykyk)\nAnother salient moment that come to mind from the gathering was getting called a ‘wise old gnome’ on the last night after walking with some friends as a DMT trip sitter. Talk about a flattering comment; I laughed and promised to bring a pointy red hat on my next visit!\nThe next morning my friends Ome, Pekko and Eva departed to Vienna without me due to our travel itinerary and I made my own way to the flight a little later, meeting Ome at the departures terminal. We then rendezvous with the others during a transfer and fly onwards to Olbia together where an exceptionally grumpy taxi driver transports the final stretch to our accommodation; driving off with the boot open and while shouting at us in Italian about the windows…\n\nGute Fhart commoners, gute fhart!\n\nAd Astra✨\nGallery of Faces:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlides Gallery\nArt Brock:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoFi Conversion course:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork States talk:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/travel/croatia/","title":"Croatia: Metafest","description":null,"body":"\nAfter a number of nudges from friends I pack my bags for MetaFest in Croatia. The gathering is in a ‘techno fort’ and because it sounds like we can camp up there, I decide to bring a hammock as my primary accommodation. I’m on an all nighter with a layover in Luton airport for a six am connection; arriving at 9am in Pula airport.\nI’m knackered and every things off to a hard start; my phones outta battery and I’m facing a liquidity crunch again, unable to get internet to move some finance around to pay for a bus to exit the airport. Despite the perfect storm of contingency I’m loaned enough for the €6 bus fare and a breakfast bite.\nSo, the fort; “let’s figure out how to get there I think to myself”. “Awesome, an hours walk from the city with bags - ok let’s go” says my inner dialogue. About a third of the walk in, some travelling Italians see my thumb and pick me up. Bugger, the fort seems pretty closed and no one’s about. I plug into my solar charger to check and yes, people are elsewhere for the day.\n\nI head down to the crystal clear water nearby, have a swim and then take a rest on the ground under some bushes - nowhere particularly good for the hammock. After a few hours I’m refreshed to large enough degrees and decide to sort out my contingency; after moving some things around on the internet at the stake house I have some funds in my bank again, and folk are heading to another fort to watch the Persied meteor shower at 8pm. As I depart the stake house a car stops for me; it’s Peter and a few others he’s dropping to the fort.\nThings feel a little more expansive on arrival. A fine plateau for viewing the landscape and watching the stars from later. I’m in good company; Fotis in particular shares a lot of interest in many of the domains I traverse and seems pretty transdiciplinary.\n\nWe are left to our devices for a couple of hours as Peter and Anita head off to pick up some other travellers. As the night trickles on, various others participants arrive for the show - namely my old buddy Kay and the metacartel crew. There are plenty of stars streaking across the clear night sky tonight!\nAround one or two in the morning we leave the fort to go various ways. Since I’ve no destination other than the trees, I ask if its cool to put up my hammock around a rented house and tag along for the walk.\nIt turns out there’s no trees within the garden but across the road there is a good tree and a fence pole to hang out on, so I check about the spot with some of the Chilli crew and am given a go ahead to park up.\nThe nights pretty cold so I don’t sleep well and when the sun comes up again at six I finally fall asleep for a bit. I’m woken up at 11am by an irate neighbour who’s threatening to call the cops if I don’t pack up, so I oblige and pull down the hammock. He’s actually the landlord of the Chilli house and blows a fuse when I stop in to grab my bag…  This ticks off one of the female members of the crew who proceeds to make a mountain out of a mole hill - it’s ok, the vibe was already kinda weird despite a number of cats like Ven who were pretty cool.\nI book a hostel and hitch into Pula only to realise I booked it in another town called Farzana… both are equidistant from the fort in Stinjan so that’s ok, just a bit of a detour. I’m shattered and starving so get some breakfast and hit up a friend who’s around Pula for a touch in before figuring out the bus to Farzana at 5pm. Delirious I miss my stop but the driver is turning round anyway. At about 6pm Sunday I crash out hard in the hostel.\nThe next morning I send out some messages to friends and get walking along the coast towards Stinjan. I get confirmation that Moritz and Thom will meet me later out at the Lost Bay beach bar; a beautiful spot with a doorway into the ocean and empty picture frames hanging from the overhead tarpaulin as if the walls and content existed. I’m significantly ahead of the others traveling from Pula - who are also walking/hitching - so I grab some supplies from the grocery shop before doubling back.\n\nAfter doing some diagramming work on the beach I dip in for a swim and float around a while in the sun. Grabbing my towel to dry off I notice a guy next to me with a towel on his head getting changed - “Kay?” I exclaim, “Oh, hey!” responds the strange non-stranger, “I thought it was you”. His wife, who I hadn’t recognised, had also been stationed next to me just before my swim but she was unsure if it me… Kay was up at the fort until now and is heading for a dip himself.\nWe exchange some words before he and his family head off to the camp-ground, while I remain stationed for another bit awaiting on friends to arrive. After some time Moritz appears by the sea-door and we settle into a respectful discussion as interlocutors. We’ve not really talked much in meat space, just occasional crossings and a call; I share some geometry in my notebook in relation to the worlds he traverses and he reciprocates with interests like his book and some AI tools he’s found.\nAfter some time, Thom shows up to join us as we close out our discussions. I find the energy somewhat disruptive to the gentle chat we were having before and he wants to meet others at the restaurant in Farzana (which is coincidentally on my itinerary). He starts to order taxis to make that happen, the first of which doesn’t show up but provides opportunity to say hello to Roberto and Laura as we’re near their camper van, which is parked in the go-karting field thanks to a deal with the owner. Claudio, his father, offers us some anise liquor which is accepted by my companions before were back on our way to the restaurant.\nThe second taxi also takes a while to show but arrives this time, taking us to the Aborium in Fazana where the others are located. Amongst the faces are a variety of folks from previous lives like Lanski from my Giveth days and a few others - all of whom have eaten so we quickly order some food before the bar closes. A self identified libertarian is battles to pay the bill as he want’s to rid himself of his fiat currency; which I jokingly offer to take off his hands to which he he responds “would you like gold?”. “Sure; gold, silver, crypto, fiat are all good by me” I reply and to my surprise he hands me a gold leaf bill worth 1000/th of a troy ounce which is worth about 90¢~.\nThe veggie burger I’ve ordered is extremely tasty and the company is lively (despite being a bit energetically scattered), though people are ready to leave. A very tired looking Moritz jumps in the van with Peter, Thom and some of the others for a spin back to Pula, so I head the stretch of 50m around the corner back to my hostel for bed.\nParticipants are gathering in the techno fort the next day to make arrangements, so I walk over for approximately 2pm and lend a hand with that. I’m assigned dusting duty at the entrance so get on with cleaning some steam punk techno minions (who bite) and various decommissioned turntables before other odds and ends. The environment is pretty cool with its various nooks and crannies, so I take a wander about to see what else is around. Kay begins to set up his midi controllers for a sundown gig and turns myself and Fotis loose on his rig, smashing buttons and toying with the audio interface for an impromptu electro jam!\n\n\n\nA few friends have arrived in time for the Chilli gathering that’s over by the camp-grounds so I walk over with a few people to say hello. Laurence is first person to spot me and I him; he’s just returned from a boat trip and pauses just long enough for me to recognise him (due to my myopia) and since he’s on crutches we sit down to catch up. Thom joins us and seems pretty keen to conspire so I leave them both to their conversation. Searching for another friend that has messaged me I bump into Rich from ChinWags so catch up with him and share the retrospective of his event that I wrote. He’s delighted!\nMoving about a little I finally find my friend Jacek - an old college - and tangentially spot Stef/Mars/Marsita (a cosmic joker from the same epoch) doing pushups and rolling around on the floor. Jacek whispers to me that “Stephs just smoked a joint, so something’s about to happen”.\nSomeone suggests the Lost Bay beach bar just as I bump into my old buddy Lorenzo from Akasha hub, so we trek it over with a few others. Stef is too preoccupied with his act to recognise me - despite some pretty obvious hints like “I know who you are Stef” - before we get into a discussion by the bar.\nHe’s talking about hyperdimensional DMT geometry and cosmic everything so I share a mandala in my notebook which he brings over to the light; “you seem familiar from somewhere” he exclaims - just before the penny drops. He’s excited to see me again but also wrapped in a persona that’s pretty frustrating to interact with. Lovely guy at heart, I just wish it could shine through the mask more easily.\nI chill out with Lorenzo a little while longer before deciding to trek onwards for bed. He’s based at the campground nearby and decides to join me for the walk to finish our catchup. His calm and content energy is great for the walk under stars before we fork into different directions for the evening.\nThe conference begins at 2pm the next day - a time which happily allows me to rest well and still walk over in time for the opening ‘ceremony’. First thing on the agenda is a talk on the meta-crisis by Rob Morris, followed by “what it means to be radical” by Josh the blockchain socialist. After the initial talks are finished I spend a moment with Art Brock to see what he makes of the semantic mandalas I’m producing - particularly one in relation to the wider context of the Holochain arena. From there I’m largely just hopping into different rooms and chatting with people I know from previous lives, projects and epochs - which is whelming in an odd sort of way; the gathering feels like a really odd reunion!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe day after I gave a presentation on some octadic mandalas which blows a few minds tickled the artistic and comedic preferences of James - an old friend of mine from travels in 2019 - who found it deadpan humorous.\n\n\n\nLater in the evening I join him and his friend Sal while they mentor each other on projects; to be honest James felt like he was bouncing back from something but was maintaining focus his on the operationalisation of TrojanDAO.\nDuring their discussions I sketch out an enneagram based on their frame of performance, interpretation and inclusion. This specific triple was based on the more generic triad of DAO Alignment they had articulated as “mechanism, rules and guiding principals (values)”. Others who speak my love language! :p\nSome social time flows from here before a session where I’m “touched by the light”; a magic light for neural annealing paired with breath work guided by Sam; plenty of octadic visuals this time round!\nWhile tripping out in the visuals, I overhear a rather interesting discussion on Piercian semiotics with an exceptionally bright fellow called Benedictvs and join them after before moving to the fishbowl to dance alone bar a chair bound Laurence who’s shaking a leg pretty hard for a guy on crutches - if there were more people on the dance floor, he woulda totally dominated it despite his mobility!\nWhen we’re done shaking our demons out in the empty fishbowl, I’m about ready to depart for my hostel so help Laurence up and head back to the ground of intersecting highways; aka “the lobby”. After saying my goodbyes to various friends for the night, I head out to Laurences camper to share some mandalas and strategic insights - which he asks to record. One proposition I’m saucily suggesting is the loose formation of a WeCo Red team playing the game of capture and refactor.\nIn my personal view the app he and his partner James is working on is fantastic but also desperately needs a mobile first refactor, which he agrees on replying “do it, it’s open source - the question is who’s gonna do the work?”. I respond by suggesting that it would take agreements with people and point at the licensing issues; getting anyone involved with substantial capacity would require a MIT licence rather than GPL (the latter being hostile to commercial use and ‘tying balls to the project’ as others have articulated). He says it’s possible and that James would probably be open to that so we park the proposition for another time and go to bed.\nAfter walking over again the next day, a number of us warm up the unconference with evil laughter in the fishbowl! Maybe some lingering ghosts that myself and Laurence shook out the night before were present, as things got stupendously ridiculous. Regardless; there was much delight at this ‘vulnerability’ and a few contagious breakouts of genuine spontaneous laughter.\nUnconference planning started from here and essentially began with a discussion on ReligionDAO headed by Gustavo - under the gentle supervision of Art Brock - as religion can be a recipe for disaster but also potentially unitive force in the world. My contribution to that discussion was an assertion that neurologically religion is largely about desirable operating conditions and teleodynamic habbit loops; the sacred is simply the habbits which allow us to conserve our energy. I also chucked in a biosemiotic frame for holy ghosts as externalised impulses.\nExactly after the ariel performance in the fishbowl, I donned my extremely loud radical love kimono with the intention of attracting attention and started sheparding as many people towards James’s workshop as possible… all the while wearing the digital name tag I borrowed from Stef/Mars/Marsita while pretending he/she was beaming in from Berlin airport. I wasn’t really sure this act was working as it felt quite plastic to me but quite a crowd that joined for the final workshop of the unconf, so I assumed my work reasonably either effective or just plain lucky.\n\n\n\nFinally, before leaving for the night I spent a reasonably chunk of time interacting with Rob Morris about his story, my story, my mandalas, the Holochain conductor and the greatest “yak shaving expedition” he’d ever completed. It was a pretty good expedition; he showed me and Roberto the results!\nExistentially, Rob and his team at EthTokyo had built a pixel world with AI agents wandering the map; they had an 8-bit cartridge compiler, appropriately styled 8-bit graphics and some frigging awesome chip music as the cherry on top! Brilliantly ridiculous!!\nThe gatherings now over and I’m gone; heading out the gate I say goodbye to various friends and then walk back to the hostel. I’ll spend the next few days relaxing alone in the water while occasionally bumping into fellow travellers, before making my way to Austria where I’ll see a many of the same faces again!\nAd Astra! ✨\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/travel/portugal/","title":"Portugal: Boom Festival","description":null,"body":"\nAfter some time at home on my own in Lisbon I make a last minute decision to attend Boom festival with Alex who’s attending with some friends. I pack my bags on the Wednesday and head out on the 6pm~ train to Castelo Branco; the closest stop on public transport. I’ve no idea how I’ll get to the festival 50km from the station but have my tent with me, so assuming the worst I can always camp in a field somewhere for the evening.\n\nThe train is full of people heading to the same destination and I make  friends with some folk who are getting a taxi for the last leg of the journey. I’m with three Germans; a designer, his girlfriend and another guy who’s a loose end like me.\nAs we draw nearer to the festival there are cops blocking the road who proceed to flag our taxi down for a search. Three of us are largely left alone bar a pocket search but our loose end is checked thoroughly; he has some needles in his bag for a medical condition and no prescription with him along with some salts that are not for human consumption. They tear his bags apart to the effect of toothpaste explosions and ruined clothing.\nAfter passing through that rather intense energy wave it turns out that this poor fella has had a hell of a ride; the airline lost his luggage meaning that he had to sleep in the airport till the next morning to pick it up; his bags were found but the tent was lost.\n\nArriving in at like 01:00 we traverse the grounds to get set up at a preliminary camping spot. Johnny “no cash” - a friend of a friend - is on steward duty and points us towards some open ground where we can make camp.\nThe stages are not yet open but I decide to take a look around the site; discovering the magic of the environment minus a crowd. The lack of activity is surreal; beautifully lit environments and landscapes with no one around and a still silence in the air - the peaceful serenity was one of my favourite moments of the week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRising the next day I grab a cold shower and get on with breakfast business before heading out to explore the grounds in the day; at this point I head pretty far out towards the edges and before tracing my way back in again.\nSettling into the Chi temple I lay back and allow my heart to fill with the soft energies in the air before dancing a bit to shake out the impulses I’m carrying. At this point a selection of muddy naked folk start to amalgamate to the left of the tent and are mindful of the carefully prepared sign stating “no mud!”. They begin to bend and sway to the wind and music like trees; it’s both beautiful and psychedelic.\nOn my way back to the festivals epicentre I bump into my friend Fenix Stardust who’s out with some others looking for coffee so I join them for the walk and exchange a few impressions. He shares a story about some people that he’s just reconciled with as they had put him down at the start of his journey before assimilating parts of his narrative into theirs. Initially he was unsure how to feel about this but gracefully gave them the benefit of the doubt.\nWe discussed the phenomena of impulse arbitrage across time and space as spirits moving between us as resonant vessels, highlighting the importance of grace at all times. What goes around comes around or what comes from source returns to source. He admitted that he was struggling with this expressing a sense regret for occasionally snapping at members of the tribe.\nArriving at his crews meeting point just outside the supermarket before sitting down, he places a bunch of oranges on the table for people to pick up and take freely. A few others arrive and some take an interest in the geometries in my notebook - which brings me into a discussion on water.\nI’m offered an exchange for some mushrooms which I turn down, though others take up the offer before we head towards the ‘temple of boom’ for an act called highlight tribe; a melting pot of pretty much every genre you could think of - psytrance, blues, swing, jazz, didgeridoo and so on.\nI take the opportunity to get ecstatic, thoroughly shaking out the matrix before bumping into Ilias from Geneva, who informs me that he’s looking for a few other friends I know from that neck of the woods. Having exhausted all the resonance in my system I head off for a tour of the other spaces before heading back to my camp to put on some trousers.\nI’m barefoot at this stage and take a shortcut over the hill, which turns out to be covered with thistled leaves from the trees overhead before heading back out to grab some food and tour the grounds at night - hitting up the sacred fire stage to relight my flame.\nOn return I decide to take a counterfactual path back and am led up a hill past ’yellow camping ’where the path ends - so I trek over the grounds tripping on tent wires on the hill before finally emerging at a resting site close to my tent. I take a moment to have a smoke with one of the stewards on duty and discuss music before heading off to bed.\n\nWaking up Saturday morning, I prepare for the day with a cold shower and head out for breakfast before going for a long walk on my own again. While exploring I receive message from Alex letting me know that she’s arrived and is about fifteen minutes from the grounds.\nI head back up the trail to meet her and help transport some of her luggage and set up her tent in ‘yellow camping’, which has much flatter ground than where I’m presently parked. Tasks completed, we depart for an orientation session of the grounds that she’s not yet traversed.\n\n\n\nAfter a swim in the lake I take her past Alchemy to the Sacred Fire and outer limits before ambling back through the being fields, ducking into merchant stalls and checking out the food stops together.\nAlong the way we spot an incredibly cosmic kimono and stop in to look at some of the stores offerings. One of the store owners hovers behind me and suggests I’d look good in a full length as I pull out a particularly interesting specimen. He suggests I try it on and yes this radical love kimono looks great, especially with my hat, but upon learning the price we depart. I feel a hole inside - fuck; I’d already fallen in love with it. We make it most of the way back to the food stalls before my frugal brooding is so obvious that Alex kindly offers to cover half as a birthday present so we double back and pick it up.\n\nWe tour back through Alchemy stage before returning to enable her to rest at the tent - while I head off to pick up my own belongings and shelter. I say good bye to the Germans and suggest that we’ll likely be around the Alchemy stage in the evening. An hour later I’ve got my tent setup up again and bags stashed, so wake the sleeping Alex to grab some food before an evening dance.\nAlchemy is pumping and the kimono seems to attract some new friends on the dance floor. After moving through a few spots we hustle on to the main stage which has turned into a psytrance swimming pool that we decide to paddle through for the experience. On our way back to the tents we visit the ‘misty projections’ on the lake shore; a bunch of organismic DMT shapes projected through smoke machines with ambient surround sound. Pretty cool installation!\n\n\n\nThe next day I lie in while Alex goes off to the supermarket to grab breakfast, charge her phone and get some writing done. By the time I make over to the meeting spot she’s gone - so I head towards the music to raise my energy with a bit of a boogie. After a half hour or so I’m done and just as I decide to move on I’m greeted by a bouncing early bird who’s spotted the kimono and is finished with her own priorities.\nWe head back in to Alchemy for a bit more dancing and swim about in the crowd for a while before I spot a juggler and move towards them. Another with clubs appears nearby next to whom I notice a slyly smiling Fenix who’s already spotted me. He offers me “a shamans dose” of mushrooms which I accept before making arrangements to meet Alex at the tents for six, before departing on a solo trip for the day.\nWandering to the far outskirts of the festival grounds I begin my journey and arrive as the mushrooms are starting to kick in; baked from the sun I find a small patch of shade to lie under. A few feet away from me is a tiny pavilion with some gospel (style) musicians sharing the love; I’m melting and occasionally weep from the cathartic nourishment. As the harmony fades into natural ambience another call from the Being Fields summons me to move closer to its beauty.\nLying down, I once again let the harmony wash over me as the musicians lead a choir in praise to Lakshmi. I lay here for a bit before the music ends and head up through the fields to emerge near the Sacred Fire.\nStopping between some bike racks to roll a cigarette I hear a tortured fiddle weeping. It has the timbre of nails scraping across the chalk board of my soul and is unbearably pure in its essence; my upper chest opens up in sympathy to the expression and my feet drag me to the over to the sound check to clear out my heart chakra.\nAs the music fades once again I head past the Chi Temple of sensual bodies moving and swaying on my way to the water. Stripping off off for a dip in the lake I find myself surrounded by numerous beautiful women swimming around topless like mermaids of the sea; a sailors paradise!\nBack on the shore shore I’m extremely moved by the beauty of this place. Wondering about how this landscape of music, people and plants came to be, I find myself considering it’s initial conditions and generator function in relation to Ashbys law of variety; what kind of soul(s) have the internal complexity and coherence to give rise to this beautifully ordered plurality? It’s certainly a very pure essence.\n\n\n\nOn the move towards the Chill Out Gardens I circle past the main stage and up to the Heart Box for a smoothie, before weaving back through the courtyard for some food. At this point I’ve nearly landed from my trip and am about ready to head back to the tent.\nIt’s about an hour before six so I grab an ice tea before my return; no sign of Alex though so I sit about playing my guitar for a while and go to refill my water. At about quarter to six she arrives in from her expedition a little early and since I’ve my guitar to hand I improvise a brief song before we head off to get some food, taking the guitar with me.\nWe settle in some shade near the lake and someone wishes to borrow my guitar, which I give to them while Myself and Alex chat about the day. Another traveller interrupts us to say hello and tell us of his travels before offering us some Mescaline which we procure from him to plan a trip. As he departs we notice there’s a rather saucy circus show happening over near the water. My guitars returned and we head over watch the hoola-hoops and a lady performing acrobatics on the silks.\n\nAs the show disperses a mad man accosts us with gibberish about his humming birds and umbrella, obviously to get some attention as I’m carrying a guitar - what he really wants is a song. Alex splits while I sing him a verse of ‘the weight’ and am rewarded with a cheap humming bird keyring for the trouble… I attach this to my guitar strap and aim to catch up with Alex, after some time serenading folk in line for the toilet expecting her re-emergence I determine that she must have gone somewhere else before busking my way back to the lake. I meet another strangers curiosity and improvise a tune for him and his wife before being found by Alex once again. At this point it’s getting dark so we return the guitar to the tents and head out to meet some companions near ‘Lunched Out Lizards’ in the Garden.\nAfter grabbing some chai tea we settle into a cosy seating area surrounded by a comfortably large twisting log. Most of our companions are on MDMA but we share some convo and a massage circle before they depart for a dance at another stage.\nA this point Alex is tired so I drop her back to the tent and then head over to the Sacred Fire to catch the band I encountered a little earlier with the heart wrenching fiddle. The gig was an eclectic mix of world music and visual art marking a graceful end to a beautiful Sunday.\nMonday we decide to take the mescal that cosmos delivered the day before, so after the morning ritual I meet Alex at the supermarket and purchase a watermelon slice to fuel my morning. We then weave ourselves through the pirate market and up to the Gardens to get some hot water from Lizards. After an attempt to station ourselves in some hammocks, I knock over my warm water and get some more before moving to the being fields for the day.\nWe find the ideal shady spot under a tall tree beside a nice big rock and to plant ourselves down to take root. Using my bed cover as a ground sheet we mix the powder and hot water before drinking the somewhat acidic brew.\nCeremoniously we read a little poetry and wait for the effects to take hold. Narrating the trip a little Alex asks “do you feel like a cactus?”, to which I emphatically affirm “yes I do! I hadn’t noticed until now but I really do” - before we fell apart laughing. “I feel like mescal is a pretty still and grounded energy, like taking root in a desert” she affirms herself.\nCertainly I feel like a desert plant, a male spikey thing optimised for survival in harsh conditions. She may have considered the energy she received similar but for me it was like having a delightful little bird land on my shoulder, chirping away with observations about the plant life and trees.\nThere’s no moving us; we’re literally planted for hours and quite happy with the sounds of asynchronous wind chimes made of wood, rustling bushes, insects and the wind. At some point in our journey one of our friends from the previous night passes, sharing a few minutes with us. I don’t remember much of the conversation or anything other than that she was wearing some home-made earrings made of sparkly dinosaurs…\nAs the sun becomes less intense we hold space for each other to move around the being fields without giving up our rock and shade as we settle from this wonderfully cleaning experience. I grab us some food to eat before departing for elsewhere and passing the Boom council we observe that reading instructions are extremely taxing. Seems in this state we cannot be informed!\nOur adventures for the day are pretty much over at this point so we head back to the tents, get some food and go for a wander around the festival grounds finishing the evening off with some chai tea before heading to the lake to watch projections in the smoke.\nTuesday Alex desires to take a mushroom trip alone so after meeting some friends at Lizards around the garden we part ways. I make it my priority to go for a dip in the lake and explore the other side of the grounds so my feet take me over to Funky Beach where I sunbathe naked and tend to some messages.\nDeciding myself comfortable in birthday attire, I head back towards the main grounds only putting clothes on again as I approach the epicentre, and only due to a need to load some credits onto my wristband. While looking for food I discover a place selling juicy Omelettes in crispy bread and return for a second helping before returning to the tents for a 6pm rendezvous.\nAlex seems largely sober at this point so we head over to the lake shore and find a nice chill out spot to catch up on our day. Conversation ebbs through a few subjects and somehow lands on triangles; during which something I say upsets her terribly - which I believe to have been related to directing ones own formation - so I shut my trap and just console her. She comes round again to laughing at the situation, giggling sweetly about her upset and probably nowhere near as sober as initially assumed!\nWe grab some noodles and another omelette before heading over to the Sacred Fire to see what’s happening around the being fields. On our way there we decide to swim through the dance temple, which is particularly weird tonight with an archetype we termed “the cosmic joker” on the decks; chaotic good as the puppeteer of an insanity circus… pure ludos driving what appeared as mania.\nWhen we arrive at the Sacred fire, a sense of fragmentation becomes apparent; there’s a guy on stage going full Jim Morrison with improvised poetics about the ride of life, which sound’s exactly like Rick and Morty getting shwifty…\nLaughing our asses off at the evenings energetics we follow our trials back past the dance temple (which is grounding back into normal abnormality) and then up to the Garden. The vibe here has become similar to alchemy, while alchemy seems to have transformed into hard minimal psytrance. Something’s in the air tonight!\nOur last day on Thursday is spent taking things pretty easy; Alex is wiped out believing herself to have sun stroke from her Wednesday explorations. I leave her in her tent while I go for a wash and while returning from the showers I bump into some friends from Geneva who are leaving early to beat the traffic; I knew they were around but found it a shame we only bumped into each other as they were leaving but I guess synchronicities like that.\nI return to pick Alex up from the tents and we head towards the shade of the being fields to get some smoothies beside the sacred fire. Ducking into an underground seating area to avoid the sun we find some Irish lads having the craic with whoever’s around them; seemingly they’re going pretty hard on the wine and also just took MDMA so they’re bit much to handle, yet also friendly and entertaining.\nThey give me their glasses to claim the refund back from the wine bar, which turned out to be non-refundable, so I leave those at the counter and return to the under ground bunker with some food.\nAs we pass our mescal rock again, the realisation that I never experienced the joys of becoming one of the mud people. I figure Alex can lie down in the Chi Temple while I coat myself and go for a swim after but she’s unable to handle the music and find some nearby shade instead before I leave to coat myself in mud.\nThis is actually a pretty disappointing experience as, by now, the pool is mostly empty of thick stuff and has largely turned to stony brown water. I do what I can with the resources available before heading to the lake to wash off again and collect Alex.\nAs we walk back to the centre, we stop to get coconut water for her and we Chai from Lizards for me. Around the corner I find a funk band has setup in the space between stages so we stop for a while to enjoy them. I note that the singer sounds like the same guy that was getting shwifty at the sacred fire a few nights before; though they seem more coherent at this point - defiantly a lot less drunken galactic super genius.\nWe grab some food and a lemon aid before an wander which is probably the most ‘collected’ evening of the week; main stage has shut down and Alchemy has taken over the primary directive of tribal psytrance. The gardens has a new groove to it that’s more energetic but not too hard and before long I bring Alex back to the tents to recover from her ‘sun stroke’ before one final exploration of my own!\nAs I coast around I notice a sense of grace present that wasn’t available before; so I walk past the Sacred Fire to the edges of the being fields and through them. There are various closing ceremonies happening in each of the tents; I stop for water and end up walking beside a girl who comments on the sense of peace and stillness before tiredly parting directions for me to check out the foggy projections one last time.\nTo my surprise the smoke machines are gone and the projectors have been moved; theres now a highly pressurised fountain in their place with a much larger surface area of spray for visuals. Walking close to the shore, I stop for a while to watch some tango dancers informally putting on a show, who after some time sit to watch the projections as well.\nA woman tripping on acid walks into the shallows to perform as a naked silhouette before playing with the pressurised fountain; messing with the spray to warp the visuals - all the while shaking her thing in an exaggerated manner. Soon enough an accomplice (in white shorts) joins her to mess about in the water for a bit and coordinate on the performance. It kinda works between them but also had at least an element of cringe as well; not sure it was really much my kink but they did a reasonably job replicating the ‘flirty fairies’ phenomena some people experience while tripping. Guess that was their archetype!\nAs the clock strikes midnight, I head back to the tents to retire for the evening. Alex intends to be out super early but it doesn’t pan out that way so we casually pack up before searching out the Castel Branco bus.\nOnce again I’m playing guitar and quietly free styling in the queue, when one of the girls next to us starts to compliment the humming bird that’s hanging from my strap - the one from the kinda weird guy that stopped us on Sunday. I respond by saying “ok, well it must have been for you then” and detach it to give to them. She seems delighted with the gift, which I’m only too happy to give away as Alex knowingly giggles to herself about the exchange.\nOn the bus I’m seated next to an ex-protugese lady who now lives around Devon. She’s been up all night tripping ’till sun rise before kipping in a hammock, so absolutely delightful company while on the bus. As we get off in Castel Branco she grabs her bike from under my bags and heads off on her merry way for coffee.\nWithout much concern for departure times myself and Alex seek out an Indian to nourish ourselves and then make haste back to the bus terminal; her journey home starts as soon as we reach the terminal but I’ve still a couple of hours to go before the train. Consequentially I park myself at the station cafe and make a friend while sitting for coffee.\nFinally arriving back in Lisboa, I take the long way home before dumping my bags on arrival and collapsing; I’ve about a week before my next stint of adventures start with other travels…\nAd Astra ✨\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/travel/switzerland/","title":"Switzerland: Solstice Festival Geneva","description":null,"body":"\nAfter the Metaphorum enven in Manchester, I fly to Geneva for the Summer Solstice gathering in organised by friends at bonfire.link; a metaphor for life and an affirmation of the human capacity to self organise without calcified structures.\nArriving pretty late on a Tuesday evening I make it across town to join a gathering at about midnight. Planning has been on the agenda but I’ve missed the show. Naturally coming from abroad and having missed all the meetings I lack the necessary context to effectively contribute, so I follow my friends lead in regard to preparations.\nSetting off the day before we grab a projector from his basement along with some other items and head towards the tram outside to pick up a van. This is plan is a non starter as our station has become a final stop. There’s a womens march in the middle of the city blocking the trams continuity.\nBehind me a girl getting off the tram seems to become dizzy, starts to fall over and grabs my bag for support. As I work out what she’s up to her friends step in to catch her. Thankfully we’ve already put the projector down or that would have been a write off for everyone.\nWhat are we doing now then? Matt the van owner can’t actually drive it because he has no licence and a broken arm so as heavy as the projector might be, we’re gonna have to lug it across town to find transportation on the other side. We can manage; I’ve carried heavier up stairs before despite the health and safety regs.\nHalfway through our roughly 30 minute walk we end up in a Mexican stand off with another guy carrying a heavy fan before we finally make it to a tram going the right way. Ome’s clearly been wearing the sombrero in anticipation of this moment. Arriving at our destination we are greeted by Matt who’s thankfully brought us one of his many many trollys!\n\nLanding at his house several hours later than intended we have a brief a sit down to catch our breath and begin to load the van with all kinds of things; fridges, lights, pallets, boxes, decorations, couches, beer, guitars, kitchen sinks - you name it!\n\nOf particular difficulty was the fridge from the basement and the pallets from the balcony but we got everything in and then fired off to grab some bean bags and shelves from another spot…\nAfter sevral hours drive to Verbier, we arrive at our destination and set up one of Matts tents. A nearby rock serves as a table to slice some bread and cut up some spring onions; slathered with cream cheese our 3am snack was sweet and nourishing!\n\n\n\nWe’re completely wrecked the next day but there’s still a lot of stuff to get done; we need to load out the van for starter but there’s more to the story than the items we’ve brought - there’s a caravan on the dance floor and the guy living in it didn’t even know we we’re coming…\nLuckily he was related to one of the people involved in the parties organisation and an extreamly graceful fella; he literally calls up his mates and has them tow away his home for the weekend… The DJ booth and sound system arrived shortly after this which we place along with some tables.\nAt this point I notice a rather drained Ome heading up the hill to fall asleep on a bean bag in the chill out zone. I help with some kitchen arrangements for a while longer but am also pretty badly written off so decide to crash out in the shade as well. Arising a few hours later, things seem to have arranged themselves under the artful guidance of Lila’s directive agency. The sound system is on, the DJs are playing and there’s a fully stocked kitchen commons… Chirst on a bike, things actually panned out.\nAround 9pm or so we gather for a meal and to share some words and affirtations in relation to why we came to the festival, what we wished to give and what we wished to recieve. I’m just here for the food and drugs really, despite my interest in the groups evoloution. This kickoff Thursday was probably the most intimate of the days and to my tastes had the best music to boot. Check out some of the sets and see validate according to your own experience though:\nAt this point in the journey the foundations we’re all in place and so further work was largely decorative additions and comforts; lights, carpets, posters etc. beautiful food too as well of course!\n\nFriday morning I help out with some decorations; mainly putting in some fence poles to hang lights on leading a path to the chill zone. The company is good making the task of smashing things with a sledge hammer a lot of fun and easier than one would imagine. Of course we completely mess up the distancing but manage to finesse the mistakes into something that looks pretty decent.\n\nAt some point in the day I make friends with a fella called Rob who’s got a game called “Spike Ball” with him. It’s a team sport of two on two where the first team serves to the opposition by bouncing a ball off a trampoline kinda thing. There’s then three ‘touches’ allowed to keep the ball in the air before it has to be returned of the trampoline. However one team member is not allowed to touch the ball twice and has to pass to their team mate. Bloody addictive game!\nI must admit it was extra fun playing spike ball with those who had consumed psychedelic substances for obvious reasons. Some of them were more attuned to the game, and others just couldnt keep their shit together and were just damn funny. Pure jokes.\nAround 9pm we gather under the gazebo for the second ritual; which is to say some light logistical announcements about water conservation and being respectful to the land we are on. We then share some silence which commedically ends with the sound of someone opening a beer signalling time for a dance!\nAround midnight the cops show up to temporarily disrupt my friends DJ set. The amusing thing with self organised raves - especially private parties on private property - is that the lack of codified authority is extreamly slippery for the hedgemony to grab while searching for the ‘one throat to choke’.\n\nThe cops were fairly reasonable in the end and probably only hoping to be offered a drink but it would have been rather interesting had they decided to flex any further than their request to ‘turn the bass down a little’.\nThe sound engineer had been keeping the volume within regulation all evening and recording snapshots with a digital dB meter. And hey even if the rig was over the limit how would they prosecute a spreadsheet? Luckily there was no need to find out.\nSaturday was gloriously sunny, and though I was a bit ill from the weather I held a workshop of geometric sense making which confused and delighted others. Down at kitchen, I’m offered a quarter tab of acid before taking my ass up to the chill out zone again. On the way back up a lively friend joins me for the walk, asking rhetorically “who’s playing guitar for the people; is it me? yes, ok, of course I’ll sing and play guitar for you all!”.\nSweet harmony - the guys a fantastic entertainer! I’m feeling kinda fragile and slightly whelmed for whatever reason, probably too much exertion but the musics nourishing and while coming up on the LSD I feel patterns moving beneth my skin which animate my spirit.\nAt this point things begin to become rather archetypal; the acoustic chill out spot has become camp freedom of the rebel alliance led by captain Norberto singing redemption songs, while bondage for liberation is happening down near the techno soundsystem.\n\n\n\nThe paradox is palpable to me; we have trippy hippies bound together in escape, while the folks below are literally tying themselves up to find liberation. Affirmers and deniers chasing the same ends in opposite ways. The beauty and sadness of this juxtapositon stirrs something in me as I lay in the middle ground listening to the forces of complimentary polarity.\nAs I start to level out and head down to the main area and am asked to help with the structure for later burning; which is getting constructed by some folks who are just a little bit off their faces and struggling with cardboard and twigs.\nI depart to find some string and bring it back to the project team which increases their effectiveness by about 400%. They are having fun regardless and at some point someone asks me if I’m an engineer. I say kinda and return the question, which recieves a positive affirmation so I ask them to take over with the string.\nWith the totem somewhat on course I’m given some postit notes and pens by my friend and asked to heard some cats; get them to write something on the paper for burning later. I ask what exactly and propose something they are letting go of; “that will do” he responds somewhat flippantly and points me to some helpers.\nCracking on with this coordination task, I have some rather trippy experiences interacting with folk. My reality tunnel broadens and narrows with my various interlocutors as I connect with them and assimilate fragments of their world views. I notice that some of the more tripped out folk sober up and land a bit upon connection with me. My sobriety became their sobriety. Their spin became my spin - is this an after glow of the acid from or a repeatable phenomena? It’s repeatable.\nAs I go about this experience I also realise my initial framing of ‘letting go’ is a personal bias and that some people would rather make a wish instead so I update my rhetoric. Certain people are somewhat resistant te me aiding the culty ritual sending sarcasm and ridicule my way. I feel you fellow denier; the affirmation of narrative and ritual are indeed rather culty activities but upon such a recognition (and through the dissilusionment) we must attempt to move into post-nihilistic space or everything will cease to exist; affirm the positve to grow essence before negating the negative to realise the possible… this is just how it works.\nAt this stage it’s nearly 9pm so despite some minor resistance from friends up at camp freedom everyone is ushered towards the fire for a sermon on the mount.\nYes, things are turning monty python very quickly; my friend is standing on a mount above the fire pit with a sheep skull walking stick and a microphone to amplify his haggared voice. “Everyone shhhh, Ome’s lost his voice” someone yells. “What? Ome’s a very naughty boy?” I yell back as my contribution to the show.\n\n\n\nHonestly the show really doesn’t need my help; everything is perfect already and the scene is about as brazen as it gets. Graciously, through a barely audible croak the prophet speaks; “todays ceremony has to do with fire”… “FIRRRRRE!!!” echoes a well intentioned attendee; who inadvertantly triggers a coordination failure as the totem is rushed onto the fire by its tripped out creators to much laughter and applause.\nMy friend rolls with the chaos as gracefully as always, though the raucous crowd is pretty hard to be heard over - few are listening. Notes are burnt on the fire before instructions can be properly articulated and people are kinda doing as they please.\nDespite a hardy spirit that unwilling to give up the ghost; I’m saddened to see the lack of care shown by attendees - my friends taken his fair share of damage from spearheading all this and at this point seems utterly haggared. Folks are shouting over what would otherwise be a rather sentimental moment and many seem almost gleeful to jump into the spotlight. I get it man, fuck the king right?\nAfter a bit of comedic shit slinging the unCeremony receds back to dancing. I shed a few tears at this point as I’m personally aware of the efforts needed to sustain such an affirmation when there are challengers at every corner. Shake it off, celebarte - for tomorrow it’s over and we share a last supper…\nPackdown is easier than load in, which is often the case with events. Around 2pm the group gathers for some food a last supper where my friend lets the group know he’s no longer gonna push forwad as a leader, sharing that those he started with seemed to fall away over time. Indeed the burden of responsibility felt palpable.\n\nThe king is dead, long live the king.\n\n“It will either be a funeral or a rebirth, I do not wish to watch things fade and will activly try to kill it if people don’t take over; you are welcome to try and stop me”\n\nWith that we finish tidying and head home for some well earned rest. I remain in Geneva a few days longer for a Tuesday gathering and then fly back to Lisbon for a hackathon.\nAd Astra ✨\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/travel/metaphorum/","title":"UK: Metaphorum Manchester","description":null,"body":"\nAfter a couple of weeks at home I’m ready to traverse the reality graph once again; I’ve been figuring out my next token and from a number of options presenting themselves I decide I’d best be of service heading to Metaphorum in the UK.\nSadly this means missing Playdrive and Let Me Think, the latter of which I’d already turned down due to budget but the former, held in the Commons Hub Austria, was really calling out! I’d have loved that one as all work and no play makes Josh a dull boy; you know it, I know it and damn playing with Laurence and seeing some old friends again would have been incredible!\nDespite all this I head to Manchester to learn from the Stafford Beer transmission and those following his lineage; I honestly don’t know what I’m in for but colleges from H3uni.org are attending and it seems like the important schelling point; John Hicks is presenting on designing for accessibility and Ian Kendrick is part of the organising team. Before I get too far ahead of myself - here’s the Programme.\n\n\n\nDAY 1\nArriving on time for the first days kick off I receive a friendly greeting at the front desk from Ian and John who further introduce me to Jon Walker, a lovely older gent working on the organising committee with Ian.\nWithin minutes of my arrival though the conference is starting with the welcome address, followed by Angela Espinosa’s presentation “Viability through emancipation – learning from VSM practice.”\nThis exposition highlighted her VSM work within grassroots organisations and for me served as decent aspirational target since she’d helped numerous organisations reform and refine their practices to become reduce their overheads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter this you can see the programme bifurcated into two tracks running in different rooms and I chose to stay in the main hall with Robin Asby who was talking on “Designing Democracy; a systemic blueprint for governing”. This was a fine presentation on the core tenants of the Viable Systems Model and how we can look at government and nation states through such a lens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a break for sandwiches, I decide to stay on in the main room for Johns presentation on accessibility. The key points made here was that without paying attention to accessibility a large part of the environment is excluded, which in turn limits internal variety also. Slides below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing Johns lead was Trevor Hilder with a presentation on “Why the VSM is the organisational physics of sociocracy”. Having become a director on the board of equal care coop (mission circle) he realised that the underlying principals which enable Sociocracy to function are those of a VSM. Through such a pentadic lens Trevor was also able to map the coops existential structure to its implicit essence; or what he called “the moral modalities framework” - interesting!\nAfter another break chatting with some of the younger participants, we’re drawn back inside. I make a deal with John to attend the workshop of dissent upstairs with Joe who I was just chatting with, while he attends the GPT workshop in the main hall. For whatever reason my feet rather quickly lead me back down to the man hall; I guess it’s because I’ve learnt plenty about dissent in the last years and while Joes PhD work is bound to illuminate some blind spots my inner geek really just wants to make LLM go brrrrr so I head down to the AI crowd to see whats shaking.\nOur table is beautifully diverse; John Hicks is holding accessibility in mind, Benjamin Taylor is thinking about technology, Joan O’Donnell with LLMs for trauma response and critical debriefings - and myself as ad hoc facilitator / note taker (aka guy with markers doing the framing). This was a fine old amble across conceptual space that seemed to coalesce to some degree on paper:\n\n\n\nNext up in the main room was a presentation that was probably most adjacent to the enrichment of my own interests; Stephen Davies on “accessing the zone of emergence” - where he shared many specific and relevant insights from running syntegreations. My fire lights up on this jam and gets me enthusiastic as I realise when orthogonally mapped that this is an applied form of John Bennetts Systematics; which I can use to specify all kinds of protocols with directed intentionality! Phew!\nWhen designing for emergence of new levels of social cooperation at scale these are the conditions (according to team syntegrity)\nConvene a set of agents that agree to a bounded domain and set of rules.\n\nInfoset/participants are engaged based on interests or knowledge relevant to the opening question; the focal point of convening or agent selection.\nParticipants drive topic space / agenda development. Members, critics and observers have specific rules of engagement throughout team meeting.\nProcess of task activities is prescribed; both for agenda setting and meetings.\n\nAgents must experience working across three levels of recursion simultaneously.\n\nEach person arrives in their own personal identity. They receive team identity and engagement paths through the meeting\nEach person is a member of two teams. They act as a critic in two meetings, a critic in another two and observer in four. Role overlapping is critical for info sharing and feedback loops.\nTeams return to plenary session at key points in the day to anchor the group identity at full scale.\n\nAgents must work in a continuous process with a minimum of three iterations in rapid succession\n\nField setting and grounding in the current realities of the agents. “What is”.\nFocused on possible futures and generates options for consideration grounded in realities of iteration one. “We could”.\nFocused on preferred futures and teams generate a priority set of preferred or recommended actions based on the possibilities generated in round two. “We should”.\n\nSourced from slides presented at Metaphorum Manchester by Transformation By Design. Thank you for sharing Stafford Beers work with such syntegrity.\nAs this session ends I head upstairs to Ian and Alleannas workshop to participate in the VSM game they’ve organised. Groups are sat at different tables and tasked with a scenario where three sisters are managing a family business. Each group represents a system ‘tier’ and must coordinate with other tables based on their role. It’s pretty tough to get a grasp on this transitional object as there is a lot of information and I’ve not yet memorised the VSM but the games a rather illuminating scenario none the less!\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point in the day its time to hit the pub, which is where I learn about the history of the LETS (Local Exchange, Trading, System) space from John Waters; a veteran for the softwhere sphere and VSM spaces. It was pretty interesting to work through his logic regarding forms of money and values as I’ve swam in similar waters and even encountered many of the folks he’s worked with in the years gone by.\nAfter a lively discussion on this topic I ended up joining Mark Labertz for a VSM learning journey. As it turns out, different folk have preferences towards subsystems and Marks was apparently the often forgotten system 3* star; it’s reflective capacity.\nWhile I’ve not got a massively wide background on the VSM model - it would seem from experience that my favourite part of the system is the algadonic channels… (I love growing through life and stress, contract owners and licences, my heart bursts through my chest, I’m rescued!)\nMost attendees at the pub head to a restaurant together as I decide to head back to my hostel for a sleepless night considering the possibilities that Stephens presentation unlocked in my head regarding systematics…\nDAY 2\nThe next day I make it into the conference hall a little late missing the morning sessions… Damn, I missed Kelsies workshop on aligning DAOs to precidents in cybernetics… that would have been fun. I make it into Ivo Velitchkov’s presention on “viability of personal knowledge management systems” instead which is centred around the history of Zettlekasten and how to implement a viable ‘second brain’ style system. As an avid PKMs user I’m pretty familiar with  the history but the presentation reminds me to retune my interface and suggests I should expand my system with new lenses (currently I’m just using a basic triad as my filing structure but other geometries might also work well!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext up to bat is Peter Kawalek on “Designing data freedom: Stafford Beer’s work applied to civil rights and criminal justice” - which was rebranded to the more apt name of “security cybernetics”. Unexpectedly Peters presentation shed some light on what the operational arm of government (the cops and law enforcement) were actually dealing with in this day and age; oh my god - the poor bastards is all I can really say.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough his presentation it becomes increasingly clear that the variety of the criminal landscape is way beyond anything that our legal system is able to cope with. Due to this the algodonic channels are frigging screaming; not only are the cop tired but the whole legal system gets backed up with data vs data arguments, putting juries and judges to sleep.\nAt this juncture I was uncertain what to pursue so stepped into Michael Wards PHD presentation “From reductionism to systems thinking: a complementary approach to emancipatory change” which pointed to a number of interesting leads and a key insight that emancipation is the reconciler of theory and practice. Sounds legit.\nMingling through a lunch break we come back into session for Czeslaw Mesjasz’s “Complex systems management and the traps of sustainability and corporate sustainability as polysemic notions” - which is admittedly a bit of a mouthful!\nCzeslaw was an interesting chap though; extremely animated and unconcerned with his audience in the slightest while covering a lot of ground in a short space of time. His message was pretty simple; meaning is messy!\nThe notion of Polysemics was also new and novel concept for me and essentially treats language as semiotic impulses that can be interpreted through many lens… my own preference being Bennetts qualitative geometries of course!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the Czeslaw assimilation came Benjamin Taylor - the gentleman that I’d discussed AI DAOs with earlier during the GPT workshop. He presented “The Viable System Model and Human System Dynamics through the lens of Barry Oshry’s Organic Systems Model” inclusive of some rather psychedelic history about the “Power lab” which was an experimental testing grounds for the examination of power dynamics - but starting with the metaphor of the blue dot!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blue dot symbolic points to roles and responsibilities and how they get distributed. He also covered some of the paradoxs organisations face when trying to evenly distribute their load; a story of how “stuff happens” and how pressure builds up in the system. The presentation included a number of ‘essential balances’ - prescriptive words and wisdom worth sharing:\nViable systems balance the forces of love and power alongside the part and whole. Robust systems balance the forces of differentiation and homogenisation, with individuation and integration. This can be stacked  in a 2x2 matrix where:\n\nDifferentiation leads to increased adaptability = Power for the Whole\nIndividuation leads to increased autonomy = Power for the Part\nHomogenisation leads to stability = Love for the Whole\nSupport leads to Integration = Love for the Part\n\n\nBesides this 2x2 matrix there was some good advice on resolving some org pressures by “being a middle who maintains independence of thought and action”:\n\nBe the top when you can\nBe the bottom when you should\nBe a coach\nBe a facilitator\nWhen they’re fighting, just stay out of it.\n\n\nAt this point the day has ended - so as is Metaphorum tradition we retire to the bar for further conversation. This time I’ve bunked out a little early to spend time with Trevor and share my Pillar back story with him as he had a bloody hilarious encounter with Dave Siegel who turning up to Liverpool street and told a bunch of bankers that their offices would be empty in five years - yep, sounds like Dave’s style of controversy. Trevor was looking to hook David Atkins (from Holochain) up with him but upon conferral decided he might be a little difficult so sent him towards Art and Eric instead - the rest is history…\nAt some point in the middle of this story we end up discussing enneagrams and Trevor conveys a backstory about Idris Shah; the guy that took over Sherbourne House from Bennett before selling it… wow, lots of historical enrichment with the story of how Bennet met Gurdjieff and Opensky while working border control for the British government and was apparently the guy who granted them both visas.\nGrudjieff apparently found the UK a little oriental for his tastes and departed for Paris while Opensky stayed put. At the time of Openskys death his widow tells Bennet that Gurdjieff is still alive and in Paris, which was rather unsuspected for Bennett but apparently less so by Gurdjieff, who inherits and uses the proceeds of Openskys will towards repaying some relatively large debts he’d accrued - “what a bloody operator” Trevor chuckles!\nAt this point Marcus, a friend / mentee of Trevors working on a startup for Island energy arrives as we continue into the discussion; bringing us to encounters with Stafford in the 90’s. At this point in time Staffords apparently uninterested in discussing the VSM but took special interested in the meaning of the enneagram or at least the page Shah left behind in his book that Trevor stumbled into. Faxing this page to Stafford certainly got his attention as he was over to the pub with Trevor the next day!\nAt this point Trevor kindly offers to take us both for a meal so we decide to leave the pub and continue the history lesson over Pizza. At this point we end up talking about other mutual acquaintances that pop their heads up in the crypto tech scene and then disappear and resurface due to controversy, contingency and gossip - it’s fun to compare perspectives from the sidelines; really weird stuff seems to happen. I’m gonna suggest that we go around binding time with words or writing narratives and then get caught in the mess, which subsequently needs to be snipped or unravelled in order to relieve the pressures - schism etc.\nDAY 3\nThe last day is upon us and for me its another lateish rise again meaning I miss Mark and Kellys workshop but am just in time to receive the handout and notice the SoFI VSM diagram that looks like a kaballah with extra nodes.\nMan all these high level consultants like Stafford and Bennet were frigging mystics I swear! Funny thing is I’ve seen this mandala before in the Regenerative Tech Community Discord as my friend Chris was sharing it; oh, haha small world - he’s been talking to Marc already and were just used as an example in the talk I just missed…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then have a presentation/workshop on “Viability and Sustainable water management” in the Amazon to work through some of the issues of a real use case. I was hoping that this might inform an octadic mandala I’m working on with Atlantis DAO but the context was perhaps too desperate to compare across.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a short break were presented a video from a college that couldn’t make the event on “VSM application insights and questions from our VSM application research group”. Interestingly this opens up some opportunities to expand the models thinking by asking question like where does marketing fit? This is quite refreshing as it takes us out of silver bullet territory treating the model as a useful tool; thankfully many of the participants despite being well versed didn’t treat the model as a doctrine - which often happens with favourite reality models (I’m a sinner too!).\nJohn Waters, my friend from the pub was up next to share the architecture of the software he was working on with his presentation “Applying some cybernetic concepts to planetary viability – a skeleton on which to build.” The root ontology seemed to be based on the permaculture triple of “earth care, people care, fair share” and seemed like a pretty interesting project that had a number of similarities to other systems I’ve encountered; what I liked about John’s initiative was his pragmatic sense of imperative and building for now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast up for the day was a fella called Gary Alexander with his presentation “A new common sense or VSM for all”. He shows a video he made with some others a couple of years back when he had no beard - “OH I remember you” I find myself blurting - “we met in 2018 at the Holochain London meetup”. This small world keeps getting smaller and he shows the activity he’s been up to at the local level with bringing the model to the community near him while reframing the language to be more accessible!\n\nAt this point we drop into open space mode and signal our interests sitting with each other to discuss pathways forward in a kind of offers and needs market. Beyond this the organising comittee and guests share a vision for Metaphorum 2 and the potential futures for realisation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all this, things move into an AGM and I duck out to the pub with Trevor again before he catches his train and then return to hang with Ian again after the meeting. Boy oh boy has he had his work cut out but a bloody excellent job he’s done with the other organisers; a beautiful three days that has been hella informative - thank you dear organisers for an incredible event 🙏🙏🙏\nAd Astra ✨\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/travel/poland/","title":"Poland: Chinwags Poznan","description":null,"body":"\nRealising that I’ve flown a bit out of my way I make my way towards the Chinwags gathering via train with the help and direction of a rather beautiful Polish lady that aids my ticket purchase towards Warsaw main and gets me on the right carriage. She’s just returned from a solo trip to Paris to visit the museums. After a hurried ticket purchase at the station and a frantic rush to the platform I make a train that will get me to my pickup about fifteen minutes late. Signalling this in the telegram and sharing my live location the group agrees to wait for me a little longer than planned. Blessed souls.\nGetting on the bus I’m gracefully greeted by a number of faces I know from previous lives. Kris from my time at Giveth several years back, the lovely Vesta who I’ve bumped into numerous times at numerous gatherings, Laura and Nick from the 0x Salon who I met in Berlin and Owen who I met in November at LabsWeek and was thoroughly impressed by. The bus ride is calm and well composed for the sizeable group and I spend my time quietly talking with Vesta and Owen about travel, personal interests and music.\n\n\n\nArriving in Poznan we draw up to an impressive castle and are shown to our rooms. The space is full of winding passages that seem to go up infinitely, until we reach an attic on the 7th or so floor; what a view! There are small rooms with couches all through the building, which is perfectly designed for unconferences and serendipitous wandering. There’s a little time for exploration before dinner and a plenary style convergence in the main hall.\nTaken over the schedule we end with the terminal question of whether the sauna room should or should not be naked. This mole hill turns is unnecessarily made into a mountain and frustration builds through a consensus discussion that reaches no consensus. The meeting is adjourned for the evening and the group splinters into different parts of the castle to get to know each other more personally for a bit before bed. I joined the wholesome duo of Alex and another who were getting meta-philosophical outside before heading off to the clouds myself.\nThe next morning was lively; getting into the AI discussion with Remi to discuss Miladys, agroism and numerology; a conversation that started with my appreciation of his t-shirt which had a three eyed DMT kitten on it along with the phrase “I don’t care” written under it - a fun and funky style that resonates with my sense of aesthetic. Provided with a coffee from the kitchen we head outside to begin workshopping.\n\n\n\n\nWe are offered a number of topics to converse on and I join the table discussion on DAO representation. Everyone at the table promptly that agreed that voting was a stupid practice. Besides that very important consensus moment, the conversation fragmented a bit but some good riffs were shared on deliberative democracy, future governance, the nature of human assembly and “all under heaven” frameworks. A lot was said on dissent as well; the gems from our table are contained in the following pictures.\n\n\n\nAfter this we had a fine plenary session where various groups presented followed by a session on how to build a service DAO for 20~ people. Sadly these fragments were not captured for the purposes of this report as we wrapped for a lunch of lively discussion. This was followed by a workshop by Other Internet, the folks working at Trust who I previously met at the 0x Salon. There was some dark alchemy at play with the handouts of fitting into framed ontological structures that I dissented from, though I later found out that this was an intentional provocation to get people thinking about human interactions over boxes and categories. Quite the bait and switch.\nFrom here the workshop moved into a discussion on bridges, anchors and alliances based on a presentation before hand; if I recall the ontology correctly anchors were more institutional bodies that touch into more traditional regulated waters, with bridges as the link to alliances. I was pretty tired at this point though so I may be recalling things wrong; you’ll have to ask other internet about that. Here are some of the artefacts to make sense of yourself if you like!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last workshop before the day ended was a legal panel during which my memory grinds to a halt before booting up for the wholesome evening of stories and discussion around the campfire. In particular I remember enjoying Shannon’s recollections of the Ethereum scene over the last while as an organiser for ETH Denver and other events, after which I spent some time tying in with Oliver about Owens project “Vouch” / “Wavelength” (same thing, different scopes) - essentially a reputation network.\nThis is probably the most impressive original thinking of the week I can recall; bootstrapping off an in person identity solution he developed whereby one takes pictures to remember each other at a gathering to bootstrap a social graph. More impressive was he’d actually started building the project on Urbit and it had a working demo! Kudos homie, your doing better than most and your thinkings further ahead. What got me jazzed was that it was clean and simple enough to figure out where in the meta stack of ontologies it could actually fit; and I love it when plans comes together!\nMy thoughts were that in a graph based network of nodes and edges we begin to assemble objective structures which we can hang subjective designs on; the semantic triple. In this case I found myself traversing the graph as such:\nAD4M Communication protocol/ontology of\n\nAgents\nLanguages\nPerspectives\n\nTriplicate the edge between languages and perspectives into the Trivium of:\n\nLogic\nRhetoric\nGrammar\n\nWithin the grammar node we can expand to subjects, verbs, objects and then within the verbs category we can fit vouches/warrants to create reputation markers a la Owens design. Yes, nice it fits!\nAt this point I decide it’s time to give the sauna a go so head downstairs to see if I can figure it out. I turn it on and since there’s no one around I strip off for a shower that’s ummm interrupted by another guest. So much for avoiding controversy - they don’t seem particularly bothered and turn around to check the the dials. I’ve already sorted things out but it’ll be another 40m before the rooms hot enough to use, so in turn we head upstairs again to continue discussion for a bit before return; this time with a modesty towel!\nThe next day I’m down for breakfast a little late, manage to eat and then head outside for the workshop on AI meets blockchain by Vikram. Plenty of discussion and ideas about how it could be used for various ends - as well as discussion on the numerous pathways and constraints. I’m of the usual mind of when it comes to transparency - geometries, active inference and semantic ledgers. What’s left now is another evening of discussion and morning pack out to the airport!\nAddios and Ad Astra new friends! ✨\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/travel/japan3/","title":"Japan 3: Tokyo Return","description":null,"body":"\nHaving given Sogenji the boot and I snap some exotic lids and depart back to Tokyo to see my friend, arriving into the station at about 4pm absolutely starving, so grab some peanut brittle for the walk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite my sleep deprivation, I’m reasonably caffeinated though also unwashed since the last time we were together - so naturally I head for an Onsen upon hotel arrival. With five pools it was the most luxurious bath of my trip so I thoroughly soak my bones following a sequence of warm, hot, cold.\nI’m panning out in the cold tub; between the lack of sleep, travel and caffeine the world is spinning to the point where I’m almost getting nauseous. Regardless I last around six minutes in these low temperatures and feel my dopamine baseline rising - I’m feeling lively again despite all the spin.\nWe head out to grab dinner, wander around and stumble into some karaoke for an authentic Tokyo experience. Finally we check out some gift shops for souvenirs and then happen into magic stone shop is literally a wizards wet dream; sounds of running water included…\nAfter performing a coffee and writing ritual the next day, we say goodbye once again and part company. I take public transport over to the capsule hotel I stayed in at the start of my trip; mess about with sequence in the Onsen as usual and get some internetting done. Since I figure I’m somewhere in a ‘service’ modality of the time cycle I make the suggestion Regen install a bonding curve on their community pool. Beyond that I send my friend a card I was given during Pragma which might benefit a peer of his that was working on mangas.io when I met him years earlier…\nOn Friday the zipper on my wallets coin pouch breaks so I spend the day touring skate/surf shops looking for a replacement to no avail. However I do find a store with high quality goods that are reasonably priced so I pick up a pair of hard wearing baggies and a couple of fresh t-shirts.\nIt’s a weird day; a friend who’s writing a grant accuses me of treating him like GPT for not providing direct answers to his prompts which was particulary unsettling as I was contributing most of the artefacts… tangentially the other friend I messaged the night before with a card sends out an intro message saying that both myself and his friend are in the same city and should get a drink together. I ask where he is and drop a pin with my location; within a minuite synchronicity strikes and he responds saying he’s passing the capsule hotel!\nI head downstairs to meet him and catch up; he’s not in great shape as a friend committed suicide that day. Fuuuuuck. That’s harsh - let’s get that drink man. He seems pleased to have some company as things are turbulent his side; he had also just had a fight with his co-conspirator earlier in the day as well. Something in the air man. Despite the state of affairs he’s in pretty reasonable spirits and given his love of Japan he seems pretty happy to become a tour guide to the area. We head for a drink in a lively hipster quarters nearby called Golden Gai and find room in a place called “open book”.\n\nThe place is crammed but the other customers are friendly; the two couples in our immediate vicinity are both on honeymoon. We chat with them for a while and then spend some more intimate time catching up since it’s been about four years since we saw last each other. Upon departure we wish each other well and I head off in search of some food to pad my stomach; particularly those fried Edamame beans… so damn tasty!\nSaturday theres no longer room in the capsule hotel so I set off to find another place - the Uneo station hostel - which I’m absolutely delighted to find is about half the price; though of slightly worse quality. I have a call with Atkursh about his project and it’s governance before heading out to explore Uneo which is just fucking crazy at night. Gambling, sex shops, bizzares full of funky freaky fashion and drinking houses - this place has it all!\n\n\n\nSunday is graceful; while following my feet around Uneo park (the one with Bronzor and Tyrunt lids) I discover and visit a beautiful flower garden. Pretty decent timing to play the “yes and” game as some Twitter friends are posting flower photos such. There’s a zen tower here that was ordered for destruction but thankfully a crafty general declared it as property of a non-rivalrous group in order to preserve the beautiful structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point I’m starved for concentration time and wanna clean up my loose ends so take a few days to scrape by twitter bookmarks into Obsidian for later reading and enrichment; a lots been happening in the world and its been impossible to keep up with all the entropy!\nBecoming increasingly aware that my time in Japan is limited and I’ll need to return home soon enough I do some cultural exploration beyond Pokemon and temples by heading into the Tokyo Museum which hosts many beautiful artefacts.\nHere I discover many beautiful stone Bhuddas, keen mechanical metal work, sparklingly sharp samouri swords from the endo period, elaborately precise prints of and pottery. Before my time at the museum is up I pay for a screening to learn of the artwork of a masterful monk who’s name escapes me…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA friend of mine mentions that an Onsen out near the “Gundam wing guy was practically a spiritual experience” for him so I decide to spend my rather fragmented Friday retracting his steps. After some breakfast internetting I hop a train out to Koto city which feels like something straight out of Sonic the Hedgehog; namely because high speed train takes us around several islands inclusive of loop the loops, which is enlivening my inner child. I see where the game designers drew inspiration from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArriving close the Gundam base and quickly find the giant mechanoid which is indicative that I’m on the right island; setting off to find the natural Onsen I was recommended. There’s only a couple of them near but responding to some photos I sent my friend he realises I’m on a wild goose chase. I head to the mall to check out the Gundam base and finally find a replacement for the wallet that broke; all good man - I enjoyed the exploration and the train ride alone was novel enough to make the trip worthwhile! Grabbing the same line home I delight in racing a bus on the motorway below!\nThe traditional onsen is still on my mind the day after and so I do some online research to find a purifying bath which comes through volcanic rock. I choose Musashi-Koyama Onsen Shimizu-yu which has two natural pools; a black rock kuroyu thermal pool and a rich gold rotenburo pool - both containing many natural minerals to nourish the skin and soul.\n\nComing in from these outdoor pools I take a wrong turn to open the door to a breaker room (electricity) before jump in to the indoor one and seat myself against its wall - ZAP!! “oh fuck, were in a pool of water with some dodgy mains on the other side… I better tell someone”. Running inside I ask someone to translate for me and am told it’s an install for the old people… phew. Cycling through through the different pools a number of times I leave both refreshed and exhausted!\nSunday I go for a long walk to visit Sensō-ji temple; an ornate grounds built for the goddess of mercy thats surrounded by stone warrior demons. Clearly mercy from those rather vicious looking guys. The wishing shrine is covered in gold and has some incredibly beautiful black and gold doors. As with most temples, they are surrounded with merchants peddling the beautiful commerce so with my dwindling cash I purchase a chocolate pancake bun thing with what tastes like it has about 2% coca in it…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly a few days left I continue with my cultural journey and head to the Nezu shrine which is famous for it’s hundreds of torii gates. Running through the gates to simulate a spiritual roller coaster I make sure to crack my head off a number of them - seems japan was built for people about a foot shorter than me. Stopping into a bakery on the way home on the recommendation of TimeOut, I grab a panda themed muffin to taste the skilled artisanship of Japanese bakers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesday I just feel like walking and exploring a bit so I take a look around the Uneo temple and investigate the symbology. I head off towards the Tokyo dome in search of some closed botanical gardens…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor whatever reason my feet take me all the way down to Chiyoda city which is a huge Island that’s home to the imperial palace. I don’t actually realise this exists until I pick up a semiotic trail that brings me past the palaces impressive, yet closed, gates. Sadly the moat and walls are faaar too big to climb as they had previously prepared for intruders like myself, several hundred years before my arrival!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExhausted from my touring I’m about ready to fly home again so spend my last day around Uneo in the hostel baths before flying through Shanghai for a night. This is followed by Italy for another layover and then finally arriving in Warsaw Poland for a few days of workshops at Chinwags - which is in a hella bougie castle…\nGoodbye Japan!\nAd astra ✨\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/travel/japan2/","title":"Japan 2: Kyoto Tranquility","description":null,"body":"\nWaking up in Kyoto I can tell I’m a bit fried from getting so buzzed while chasing Pokemon the day before. We get up, grab some coffee in Starbucks and do a bit of writing as has become interpersonal tradition; it’s gonna be a lazy grey Saturday.\nAfter returning to the hotel to drop our bags, we set off for a walk and to find some vegetarian for lunch. This is harder than you’d think in Japan but we manage to find a decent restaurant serving a selection of tofu based meat substitutes.\n\nMy companion is pretty tired and a little dissociated from her time in the monastery so try to entertain her a little and and keep a smile on her face. We stop for a drink a hipster joint that reminds me of Sunday after parties in clubland. Upbeat DJ vibes that are perfect for an hours chill out session.\nWe head back to the hotel for a rest and I head up to experiment with the Onsen once again. I’m absolutely panning out in the cold bath but doing pretty well to last six minutes between saunas. My companion is exhausted and needs rest so I leave her to recuperate while heading out to capture the wild Pokemon of Kyoto!\nThis is a bit of a drizzly walk and waaay longer than expected but I catch my first Kyoto Pokemon while picking up a number of lids specific to the area (call them gym badges maybe?). By the time I return the days pretty much over so we chill out and watch Rick and Morty for the evening.\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday we start the day with our coffee and writing ritual before heading off to the Eastern outskirts to collect a two more Pokemon on my list - as well as visit some other less important cultural relics like the temples ;)\nFirst stop was Yasaka-jinja Shrine; a shinto park hosting an Igglybuff, Cleffa and Pichu beside its beautiful Koi pond. Aiding an air of authenticity to the shrine experience were numerous Japanese women touring the place in Kimonos; hmmm, original cosplay!?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSights seen and creatures captured we get moving towards the next spot and encounter the Chion-in temple along our route and for exercise we decide to climb the giant steps and explore. The scale is impressive; like where did they even find trees for these huge structures? Everything about the construction is enormous - just check out the giant bell!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe depart to Okazaki Park in order to collect my last real life NFT of the day while coincidentally encountering two Doge along the way - I get why these beautiful animals became a meme coin to be fair… Needing a dopamine top-up we grab some free mochi samples from a sweet shop and promptly capture a Cyndaquil and Darmanitan lid before ambling into the Heian-jingu Shrine. there are some pretty cool dragons that my Poke hunting apprentice does a decent job of imitating! (no consent to post unfortunately :p)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemporarily finished Poke hunting at temples; we set course for the National Gardens surrounding the (closed) Imperial Palace. As we arrive universe promptly signals no with loud alarm and a booming thunder clap immediately preceding a hail storm… I’m soaked so we make a beeline for a drink in search of some shelter, ending up a Japanese gin distillery called “House of KI NO BI”. Pokemon in bag and kilometres under belt we head back to the hotel for a bath and bed.\n\n\nIn the morning we perform our internetting rituals and head out Poke hunting once again; this time to the West of Kyoto. Having itched for some traditional tea the day before we keep our eyes peeled for a place to sample such and find a spot on the long walk over towards the Nishikyogoku Athletic Park; a real poke gym for once where we capture a wild Chikorita and Shiftry!\n\nRealising exactly how far our next stop is on foot we grab a cab up to Arashiyama - or more specifically the Togetsukyo Bridge. Getting out of the cab we hastily head to the Nakanoshima Area to find Kyotos last Pokemon; a beautiful flying Ho-oh.\n\n\n\n\nAt this point I promptly declare myself the ‘greatest trainer of them all’ as I’ve collected all the Pokemon I will find on this visit to Japan. There’s a monkey sanctuary nearby so we decide to head up the hill to get in trouble by throwing Pokeballs at them. It’s a long climb but a beautiful walk that answers many of yesterdays question of “where the bloody hell did the get the timber for these temples” - clearly on these hills which are full of beautifully straight trees of nearly uniform proportions… crazy nature actually grows like this!\n\n\n\nWe find plenty of monkeys at the top of the hill and are just in time for a show. No they don’t perform - but they do steal tourist equipment and already have a fellas lens. One of the keepers is chasing the cheeky blighter down and the whole troop are in on the action screeching something akin to “invader, invader, enemy of the state!”. Against the odds the keeper catches the kleptomaniac culprits and the equipment returned to the owner; what a show!!\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter viewing the whole of Kyoto from the hilltop we descend from the summit and towards the bamboo forrest. On route we stumble into Hōgon-in Temple which is exceptionally serene but it’s getting late so they’re closing. Entering the forrest the exaggerated growth of the shoots remind me of the fight scene in the movie Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon - a stereotype I’m sure that arises for many other tourists also. They’re kinda haunting I must admit; the cool temperatures and darkening light also gives off blare witchy vibes. Guess I’m in movie mode now…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe pass by a sweet store to pick up some presents and grab public transport back towards where we are staying, passing by a karaoke centre for some shits and giggles…\n\nIn the morning (17th April) we say goodbye and board trains in opposite directions; I’m headed to Sogenji with the aim of a midday arrival and my companion to Tokyo. After a minor liquidity crunch with crypto currencies I manage to make it to the temple at precisely five minutes past midday; so roughly on time!\n\n\n\nThe temple is quiet to the point that it seems as if there’s nobody around. Checking around the place I find the kitchen and signal my arrival. They inform my liaison who’s preoccupied but on his way so I offer a hand with the cooking. Chefs a decent dude and up for a bit of a laugh as we go about our preparation work during which my liaison arrives. He carries an impersonal vibe that’s pretty dismissive without having actually interacted on anything.\n\nI’m briefly shown some of the immediately relevant spaces, like where I’m sleeping, where to put my bag and given a handout and handbook on Zazen explaining the practice:\n\nGUIDES:\n\n\n\nThis is pretty good reading from first glances and we briefly discuss some of the principals, with concentration being the core axiom that supposedly sums it all up. I mention that this is one of seven principals in my own “fourth way” practice and am essentially dismissed; oh dear, I was hoping for some enrichment but it seems my liaison is tightly coupled to the orthodoxy. My ‘psychic intuition’ had already picked up on the places energetics and was screaming to get the hell out of here - and this interaction might have justbeen the exit sign. Damn, I only just got here, I internally rationalise, I’ll wait a little longer and see…\nMy liason departs and there’s some free time to check out the forest and grounds of the monastery which provide a breathtaking exploration, before we are to return for the elaborate ritual of dinner. Much formality - to my tastes this feels plain rigid with grip seems to prioritise the principal of order… which I’m personally partial to but not to this degree!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter eating we head down to the sitting hall to do a whole lotta breathing; a process that’s also pretty formalised. Everyone starts in place and with newbies like myself placed in the outer circle. For new entrants like me we are asked to perform a ritual of walking over to the inner camber and bowing before to the inner sanctum before walking its length to again bow to the monk holding space before returning to their seat. Ok, cool by me sure!\nA bell rings in the distance and the “in group” of monks head off to sit in the Roshis quarters. Once they are all gone a bell rings to signal the beginning of Zazen, during which one is not supposed to change their posture until the ring of the next bell.\nVery quickly I learn of my ergonomic imbalances which become bloody painful to hold through. Since I’m not adjusting my posture until the next bell I figure I’ll breathe into these spots quite deeply and after a significant amount of what’s essentially holotropic breathing, I feel my hands cramping. Just before the bell rings I’m asked by another new recruit to quieten down - which is 100% my intent - once the bell rings and we’re allowed to readjust posture!\nBy the next round I’ve got a handle on my ergonomics and the rest of the session flows much more easily with minimal distractions. After three or four rounds we get up for Kinhin (rapid walking meditation) and then back to more sitting. Slowly the monks who left earlier to sit with the Roshi return one by one and continue with more sitting. The first monk to return sits directly opposite my line of sight and we proceed to look through each other for the next several hours.\nAt some point in the session the monk holding space begins to wander around with a stick offering people beatings on the shoulders to wake them up. As I can sense that I’m leaving soon I wish to experience as much authentic zazen before departure so I bow to them and take two whacks on each shoulder. Yes, that’s a little bit of a system shake up and quite pleasant really. After about several hours of mindless breathing we finish sitting, putting cushions away and pulling down beds where applicable.\nBefore crashing out I read some of Aurobindo’s writing and converse briefly with my liaison who’s interested to know if there are “enlightened beings in Auroville?”. Having been quite dismissive of my opinions earlier I respond indirectly by asking “whats an enlightened being?”. He responds with a humble admission of ignorance and which in typical zen style sounds both authentic and scripted. I play along by suggesting that I don’t know either, adding that I may have met one or two of them while there. We finish our tea and go to bed where I sleep lightly, while dreaming heavily.\nWe awake at 3am quickly file out to another building, passing through light rain and move into a chanting session about the Buddah in a language that’s essentially unknown to me. I get lost in this text but quietly vocalise in the same monotonous tone so as to activate my vocal chords for the day without disrupting the rest of the group. We then put our cushions back and quickly file out to another room to do more prayer and then return to do some quiet reading; this time the text is in English and quite absorbing. From here we depart for the breakfast ritual.\nI’m then asked to sign the guest book inclusive of arrival and departure dates. I decide this is a good time to signal my departure so inform the monk that this place is not my jam and head off to let my liaison know I’m off after chores. He looks overjoyed at this and says I can just leave. I head down to the sitting room to help with cleaning, say my goodbyes over a cup of tea and then get the hell outta dodge!\nTo my senses it felt like the place was in decline and that energetics were getting appropriated from strangers like myself to sustain the inner membrane - who knows though. It seemed that there were some good people there but the place didn’t vibe; if enlightenment is liberation then subservience to an orthodoxy felt pretty paradoxical to me. Fine material but a heavy dose of concentration didn’t feel like it was on my agenda; at least not without an aligned purpose. I head to Starbucks, sort out my liquidity crunch and head to Tokyo for a final evening with my companion before her departure the next day. Once again I’m on my own, destination unknown…\nAd astra!\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/travel/japan1/","title":"Japan 1: Tokyo Energy","description":null,"body":"\nFlying from Vietnam to Tokyo, I dig into several of the books I’ve procured from Auroville by Sri Aurobindo. One of these is called “The Experience of The Psychic Being and its Growth” which seems to describe some of my more recent experiences related to enhanced synchronicity as well as some symptoms that I’ve not personally experienced… in particular the gold ‘bursting’ effect that clusters eight parametric qualities seems new, though I do seem to have touched upon the realm of golden pentads around January this year. That was freaky.\nEsoteric experiences aside, I’m totally winging it on my travels listening to what Sri would call ‘psychic intuition’ so have absolutely nothing booked upon landing. Once on the ground, I grab a coffee and see what’s available online; unfortunately most places are pretty expensive though it seems a capsule hotel in Shinjuku is on discount for the night so I book it and jump a train over from the airport taking me past the Japanese country side. The landscape is incredibly neat and tidy; somehow reminding me of a less wild version Ireland!\n\nMy capsule hotel is incredibly novel as it’s basically an “Onsen”, meaning that its modelled around a public bath and sauna. These baths are actually pretty common in Japan but I’m blown away by how lavish the hospitality is given they provide all sorts of free grooming products, sports drinks and rice bowls with miso soup. Talk about a drifters wet dream! 😂\nBefore stripping off and hopping into the pool off I double check with the attendant that this is indeed expected behaviour; he says yeah so I get naked, have a wash and start developing an ‘Onsen Protocol’ for myself by experimenting with heating sequences. The order of hot sauna followed by cold shower and warm pool leaves me with a sense of rather flaky expansiveness; relaxed and rather doolally from the jetlag I take a look around Shinjuku in search of a SIM card and some dinner; night time outside is frigging wild and incredibly high stimulus!\n\n\n\n\nAwakening from my capsule casket the next day, I head down to the Onsen once again to try a new protocol; this time experimenting with a pattern of cold, warm, then hot which leaves me feeling rather social. I grab a coffee and then head off to shake out the caffeine by taking a walk down to Shibuya city.\nSpotting the decorative manhole covers I remember that there is a tourist tradition of ‘drain spotting’ as the Japanese water companies intentionally highlight their manhole covers so that the locals are aware of where their tax money goes. Due to my personal interest in semiotics; I begin to run around the city enthusiastically photographing the floor like a stupid Gaijin!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince I’m booked to go to Pragma Tokyo the next day I decide it best to try sort out my shoes situation to avoid looking like a complete rag and bones man. There’s an interesting paradox I’ve noticed over the years that seems to relate to the Matthews effect; essentially those working their asses off tend to look so haggard and unappealing that they are passed over for opportunities, while the groomed and vital tend often to be the beneficiaries of opportunity. Since I’m intending to attract capital for a semantics project I make the effort doll myself up to avoid falling prey to such biases. Man we are suuuch irrational beings!\n\nWaking up early the next day I make sure to set myself up for success with another Onsen in the morning, coffee in the station and a decent half hour walk towards the venue. In all honesty; it’s easier to find other lost bodies en route than the event itself and a group of about seven of us pile up before we find the exact location in a rooftop conference centre.\nUpon entry to Pragma Tokyo we are provided with chopsticks and a notebook after which we proceed to the morning networking where I happen across an interesting spectacle between two gents who are politely wrestling with each other for conversation control.\nActually I’ve met one of them already - he’s from Protocol labs - though his rather eccentric interlocutor is mysterious to me. I throw in some cheeky challenges for the sake of status signalling and we’re into a relatively civilised game of triadic tennis. As the eccentric interlocutor departs, he offers his card and says goodbye; a science and technology guy hmmm - that’s pretty resonant!\nI stick around a little while longer to check in with the representative from Protocol Labs and then leave to talk to a few others in the crowd. As the Ethereum Foundation takes the stage on the subject of culture, I settle into a couch next to a really lovely guy called Nao - who was until recently leading up Coinbase Japan. He’s a total gem; open, curious and friendly - so we discuss culture building and exchange resources on the topic (like emergent cyclical theory).\nAs I depart from the couch to grab a cup of tea I recognise a passing Juan Bennet from Protocol labs. Attempting to say hello he signals that he’s getting ready to go onstage so I flash him an ok sign and resign to let him be. Pretty shortly after that he takes the stage to discuss technology trends, ecosystem building blocks and entrepreneurship in general. During the questions segment of the talk I relate to Douglas Englebart’s work on Augmenting Human Intellect and ask him “given PL’s mission statement to benefit humanity; what what kind of capabilities would you most like to see augmented”. He’s big on DataDAOs and Compute Over Data; which I reframe in my head as ‘Semantic Ledgers’.\n\nThe guy who asked a question before me related to methodology development seems like an ally; so I grab a seat next to him and briefly chat before heading over to say hi to Juan (who’s already getting hounded by a total bro dude man). I let Carlos my ally jump in ahead of me and hang back to create some space for them to talk while also enabling a clear exit path. After a few minuites of conversation Juan gracefully says he’d like to take a few more questions and warmly engages me on the subject of Xerox Parc and project Xanadu.\nAfter a short lunch break Stani from Aavve companies takes the stage to talk about and promote lens protocol; a web3 social network. I’ve seen a number of people pointing to their lens profile but am generally unfamiliar with the project. I appreciate the way he’s leaning into the positive potentiality rather than getting caught in problem thinking so feel inclined to eventually learn more so I ask him about digital identity during the questions round. Given his response I offer to share some design and end up jamming with him near the VIP section; this feels incredibly humble and receptive for a guy that’s just come off stage. I like Stani.\n\nThere’s some blabber blabber lightning presentations after this about defi stuff; during which I hang out with a pretty chillers old fella from a manga company who’s working on a NFT story called ‘laid back llama’ before Balaji teleports onto the big screen via Zoom.\n\nMan this guy is smart and incredibly driven to get shit moving due to his rather unsettling perspective of the macro economic situation which he does a good job to present eloquently. He asserts that he’s not a doomer but is also thoroughly bell ringing about what he calls an omni-crisis. I’m a little torn about this because while he is justifying his position with facts I lack the macro economic experience to discern if whats evident to him seems likely. Still, he’s damn smart and it was great to pick up that transmission!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy new friend Nao has been cool enough to share another event with me and heads over during Balajis talk. He’s gonna see if he can leverage his clout to get me in and suggests I hang back until he knows for sure. He fails at the hero pass though I’m certainly grateful for the efforts. I hang around for the networking and meet a number of really great contacts that are all smart, interesting and resourceful. In particular I make friends with a guy called Cole thats interested in building on lens protocol the day after at the hackathon so I jam with him on some identity primitives and wish him good luck.\n\n\n\nAs I leave the building I see trees and decide to take an unusual exit - bumping into Cole once again. We wander around the rooftop garden and guesstimate a route out of the building only to encounter a Super Mario statue that leads us in to a Nintendo store. Oh hellll, this is a curios spot; the whole place is themed stores - Nintendo, Pokemon, Street Fighter, One Piece, Hello Kitty and a bunch of others; quite the cornucopia of novelty in here!\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally making it out of the commercial novelty trap, I decide to wander home through Shinjaku park passing the many beautiful flowers hit the Onsen once again upon arrival. Mmmm miso rice for dinner and a wander round the famous crossings!\n\n\nMy next destination is Sogengi temple to try out Zazen meditation in a legitimate Zen monastery but that’s not for another few days; I’m due to meet Alex upon her departure which seems to be happening slightly early. I’ve one thing to do in Tokyo before I meet her though… catch all the local Pokemon. Yes. Pokemon.\nEnthralled with drain spotting as my tourist activity of choice I have discovered there are a number of Pokemon lids around Japan and right here in Tokyo city there are precisely eight of them to catch! These are distributed across two areas of the city; six in Machida and two in Ueno. Machida park has the greatest concentration of them as apparently their progenitor lived nearby, so I decide this will be my first stop. After this I’ll go to Ueno get the last two before heading back to the hostel to pick up my bags and then down to meet Alex in the evening.\n\n\n\nBesides the rare Pokelids I seek within the park, Machida is a new area - so I’m delighted to find some new covers designs of the off brand variety on my way to the entrance. Man this place is so beautiful the pictures compose themselves - which is lucky because I’m not much of a photographer!\n\n\n\n\nI follow my intuition and quickly stumble into a Pollywag! I toss my Pokeball and capture the tadpole instantly, after counting to three for my flash to go off its sealed away into my gallery. I’m now officially a Pokemon trainer but this thing will be useless in a fight. I move onwards towards open ground where I find an number of cool off brand lids; a squirrel with an umbrella and two kingfishers.\n\n\n\nTheres a giant water statue nearby which looks like prime pokeland but alas construction workers have taped it off. However the Japanese are easily the most polite and helpful culture I’ve ever encountered; a worker spots me looking for something and asks if I need help. I tell him I’m poke hunting and he escorts me to the gym!! Domo origato, this gent has just helped me capture a Squirtle, Rattata, Pidgeot and Picachu across two lids. Around the corner I find an Oddish, Catterpi and Weedle; this games already far more fun than I’d expected and I feel like a total winner for capturing so many critters so easily; only two left in this park!\n\n\n\nI set off again following my feet and am brought over a hill and past some streams. As the path rambles on I happen across the Machida City Museum of Graphic Arts and decide to pop in. The free exhibit is full of old school prints made from wood blocks; which is an aesthetic that I’ve always had resonance with. It’s bloody gorgeous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaving the museum I attempt to buy all the post cards in hopes of training an image generator with them but they don’t take electronic payment, which sends me on a banking mission. After a modicum of difficulty but ultimate success over the bank machines I return to pay the cashier and take away a number of ‘choice tokens’.\nBack to my poke hunt, there’s two more critters to find but and get distracted by a swing (with ‘eat the elephant’ lyrics in my head). Coming down from the hilltop I’m once again reflecting how bloody beautiful this park is. The pools and gardens are breath taking; full of winding paths that have wuwei written all over them. The composition is unparalleled. At the far end of the park I capture my Bulbasaur and Charmander lids!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll things considered, it’s getting pretty late in the day. I’ve been enjoying the park thoroughly but it’s time to get to the other side of town or I’ll not make it down to Kyoto later. I head for the train and trip it over to Ueno about an 45m away. I’m pretty charged from my days activity and realise I need to add an hour in order to make it back to the hostel so I blast it round the park as quick as I can, while also snapping new lids and sight seeing at 2x speed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheres a shinto shrine in the middle of a large reed filled lake that takes me off course a while before I reorient myself and proceed with the poke mission. Up the stairs past another temple, ever vigilant I ensure not to miss any new lids nor the beautiful cherry blossoms, I make it to the Tokyo Museum to capture Baltoy, Bronzor, Wynaut and Tyrunt. That’s it; I friggin’ caught ’em all in one day!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to the hostel to pick up my bags and grab the train down to Kyoto. After some minor cashflow issues, a couple hours train ride and a reasonable walk to the hotel with my heavy bags, I arrive just before the clock strikes twelve. Having earn’t my gym badges; I’m ready for a good nights rest and make contact with embracing company!\nAd Astra ✨\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/travel/indiapt4/","title":"India 4: Auroville Evolution","description":null,"body":"\nSettled and stable once again in a reasonably priced hotel; I decide to head out for coffee in the international zone and see what trails there are to follow. Not wishing to miss the experience of transcending in the Matrimandir I set course towards the giant golden egg in hopes of finding a means to book such a visit.\nI begin by exploring the visitors centre and learn that Auroville was not built for it’s initial settlers but instead to inspire later generations of visitors. As I depart I stumble into a systematic cluster of parameters that are apparently the mothers symbol; a dodecad of archetypal qualities to flowers - woah!\n\nFollowing the trail further there are a number of tokens clearly left behind for adept scavengers like myself. I’m delighted to find this work as it ties into the material that I’ve been studying at h3uni.org and consequentially wonder if Aurobindo and Gurdjieff migh have ever crossed paths?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuing along the path I collect all twelve of the tokens above en route towards the giant cosmic egg. Just before my arrival at the viewing spot, I pause a moment to enjoy the sprawling Banyan tree; it’s gigantic and seems to have several other trees grafted into its extensive branches for both support and nourishment. I have to send Jimi this beauty so snap a picture!\n\nLooking out over the gardens from the viewing spot it dawns on me that Auroville is far from complete; even the gardens around matrimandir are still under construction as they are apparently still putting in the water works.\nA flashback of my time at Liminal Village in Italy arises where I helped Roberto with a grey water pool, though this is on another scale altogether! Sandro would have loved the diggers here for sure; he always had a hard-on for the big toys and these were a level up on the ones he was driving!\n\n\nI set off back down the road again with no idea where I’m headed, hedging along the outer perimeter before hitting the gate house. Maybe I can book a meditation here? I check in with the guards who say no and are utterly unhelpful about how to book so I message Laurence to find out how he managed to do so before continuing my hunt for the next serendipitous token.\nHmmm, I’ve been walking for a while and haven’t found much yet. I’m enjoying my jaunt but finding only a few curiosities despite the amusing street signs; I decide to visit Humbleness avenue before venturing into Prosperity as this seems like an appropriate order to proceed as one certainly doesn’t wanna do it the other way around… Besides some pretty flowers there’s are not many interesting curiosities so decide to trek back towards my initial point of departure at the visitors centre.\n\n\n\n\nThis leads me past by some rather aggressive dogs that come after my heels and need to be scared off by threatening them with a coconut while barking and growling back; they run when chased which I internalise as a life lesson.\nEn route back there are numerous colourful temples with pantheons of rainbow gods as well as some smouldering grey ones that look like portals to the underworld. Some beautiful mandalas round these parts too; Rangoli’s as tribute to Lakshmi (or as Rishi put it NFT’s to god)!\n\n\n\n\nBack at visitors centers I decide to plunder the information boards for hidden parameter clusters; the Aurovillians have done a good job with their systematic groupings - bravo you beauties - you’ve been preserving your esoteric transmission exceptionally well; though I’m still not sure exactly sure the magickal roots this place, it’s pretty enigmatic and the lineage feels legit! (Max Théon apparently).\nChecking Twitter out that evening I notice Joe Brewer’s emitted some warning signals related to the Regen Foundation after having been messed around and instrumentalised by them. Feeling a degree of accountability towards that unfolding I ask him if he minds sharing some of the details and after some initial reflection on these I recall the letter that arrived from chaosmos the day before within Jashs gift and decide it’s time to sink the boat by publicly sharing my own experience and testimony on Twitter - aye - what a dramatic universe!\nExpecting a bunch of vitriol in response I decide to turn off my phone and start Friday with some legitimate Vedic healing, which did not disappoint. The shaman had a collection of wooden chisels that he used to affect 144 points in the feet which I note as an interesting multiple of twelve… empirically speaking my energetics were notably effected from this therapy and I became unusually chatty for my pre-caffeinated state. I learnt the shaman made all his own medicine as well though I didn’t try them due to the relatively high cost.\nFeet in good shape (for once), I set off for morning coffee and to check the activity board. It really didn’t seem like there was much on bar some “power yoga” a couple of hours later so I decided to kill some time by walking out to the movement centre in order to give that a go. As it was my friends birthday a few days prior, I’d been trying to call through to wish him well and finally got through on the walk. He’d recently become a father and seemed pretty happy to be white picket fencing with his beautiful and caring wife Maddie.\nThe power yoga session certainly lived up to its name; starting slowly but quickly picking up pace to become exceptionally challenging (for me at least). The instructor noticed my struggles and reaffirmed the invitation to retreat into child pose whenever we felt necessary, which is something I was already doing whenever things got too tough for me. This is something that a friend experienced in Samkyha mentioned as a stumbling block on his journey so was only too happy to surrender when past my capacity. I thanked the instructor for a fantastic stretch and set out on my way; I felt a liveliness in my feet and my general ergonomics from the legs to chest were feeling pretty damn good at this point!\nSaturday I decide to entertain myself with some of challenges Laurence had implicitly set me up with earlier in the week; “Transcend in the Matramandir”, “grab some cookies from the Auroville bakery; choconut”, “Tantos has excellent food” etc. - and since Jash wanted to head in the rough direction got in the car with him and ticked the latter challenges off the list and sent back the evidence.\n\nJash is headed back to the hotel so drops me near the Svram research centre for musical instruments where I test out everything in store and then join a tour in the sound garden. The tour introduction has already started and as I’m paying for my ticket the larger than life host asks some rather metaphysical questions that I respond to with a cosmological quip that he enjoys (I can’t remember what).\n\nFrom here we break into groups with different guides and tour the garden; my guide seems quite the miser who’s just stating surface level information so I break off and investigate the toys on my own. This somewhat pisses him off as he gets rather upset once I happen upon the cymatic plates; he accuses me of disrespecting the instrument and ignorance of it, to which I demonstrate considerable knowledge otherwise and he kinda changes his tone. At this point I’ve played with the various instruments anyway so decide to leave the garden based on his unplayful vibe.\n\nAs I’ve also been mistakenly charged 10x the tours ticket price I return to the music store to get a refund and as I’m leaving bump into the host who actually turns out to be the store owner. He begins to engage me with Aurovillian metaphysical philosophy and we end up in a bit of a satsang together around the spiritualisation of matter and such. He’s delightfully entertaining and seems to be sharing some pretty advanced teachings and intuitions. Somewhere in the passing hours he informs me that I was brought to Auroville for a reason which seems both true and a truism!\nAs the sun begins to set I head back to the hotel to find Rishi and Jash in a design jam. They suggest a gig in the same area where I started the day and since Laurence already challenged me to grab a cheesecake in Aurojar cafe after recieving my previous messages the proposition appeals.\nI depart on foot to close out the loose end and send through both a proof and a request for less hedonistic challenges. He asks me if I ticked off the matrimandir, which I’ve booked for the final day before departure and awake at 7:30am for such a privilege.\n\nArriving to the visitors centre there’s a queue to the auditorium where one is informed of Aurovilles history and symbology. We then jump into a bus to the cosmic egg and are permitted entry into the gardens once we’ve turned in our phones and electronic devices. From here we are led into the Matrimandir in a ritualistic fashion, replacing shoes with white socks and then following a spiral catwalk from the ground floor to the meditation chamber.\n\nIn here, a beam of light enters through a hole in the roof channelling the sun into the largest contact ball I’ve ever seen; at 70cm its apparently the largest perfect glass sphere in the world… This is supposedly symbolic of concentration in that it focuses the light downward into the marble lilly pond several floors below. Holding it’s weight are several hexads stuck together that are supposedly Aurobindos symbol, though more widely known as Solomons seal or the star of David.\nThe chamber has round walls so it’s an (intentional?) acoustics nightmare; every tiny sound carries and coughs reverberate loudly! There is little to no silence in the room; despite it being mandated. I wonder if this is all an elaborate joke referencing our inability for stillness?\nAfter leaving the inner sanctum we are left to investigate the grounds and invited to meditate in one of the twelve energy centres of our own choosing (based on the mothers symbol above). These little enclaves were kinda cool with their coloured lighting and funky shapes on the wall; nothing too special but would make cool saunas - which is what the one I visited was due to lack of air conditioning!\nThe marble lilly pond below was also kinda cool, though I honestly got culty swimming pool vibes from the whole place. It’s a decent spectacle but frankly it felt pretty plastic and material - which they are assumedly trying to spiritualise! I found it all to be quite interesting magick none the less; especially the geometric symbols at each entrance. What’s the messaging here? And what’s the meaning?\n\n\nThe platonic solids in tetradic petals huh…\n\nHaving started the tour inside the centre of the cosmic egg, we are freed to check out the truly beautiful gardens. Similar to the mothers symbol there are twelve petals around the egg that each representing a different cosmic quality. Only four of the twelve gardens were complete; though several others were under construction. Here’s a photo from the Auroville website.\n\nDeparture\nFinishing up here I return to the hotel to say goodbye to Rishi and Jash before hopping into a cab to the airport. It turns out my first flight is delayed, which scuppers my exit. I’m told that I can get a refund for this and grab an alternative ticket to Mumbai for $30~ which I take.\nChecking in for a flight to Vietnam I’m asked if for a covid test; whoops, nope forgot about that… Vaccination, nope. “Where can I get one?”. “Outside” says the checkin agent and takes me towards the exit. She asks the security where it is and they say its closed down. Crap. I decide to google an answer and make a dash for it given my limited time. The first recommendation is non existent so I google an alternative and try jumping in a cab. The driver points out that there is a test centre just over by the entrance and there actually is… aye, thank god for this guy!\nI ask for two tests the immediate one and the one 48 hour test I need to give the check-in desk for Vietnam. The lady here is cool with that but doesn’t have a card reader, she let’s me take the tests before running inside with all my bags in search of an ATM. Literally all the ATM’s in the airport however are outta cash or not working so I ask an American tourist if he’d be able to help me out.\nHe kindly agrees and I give him the spare change I have for his larger denomination bill before bringing it back to the PCR lady only to find out I’ve given him too much change! Since I’m only a little short however she agrees to let it slide.\nExhausted from running around with my bags and several kilos of books I finally make it to the check-in desk to and the celebratory fanfare of agents who didn’t think I was gonna make it. They give me extra leg room seats and I head to boarding.\n💎 Good bye India, you’re a precious jewel! 💎\n\nBefore we depart here’s a selection of Rangoli and other tokens found on my Easter egg hunt around Auroville that don’t quite fit anywhere else!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/travel/indiapt3/","title":"India 3: Auroville Involoution","description":null,"body":"\nMonday we say good bye to the folks round Atlantis HQ and after some lunch we set off for Auroville with the unexpected addition of Treegens Jimi, adding some welcome dynamism to the party of myself and Rishi.\n\nStopping at various points en route to enable Jimi to host various twitter spaces we exchange tunes and banter while beelining our way towards a hotel just outside Auroville. Were trying to make a 9pm zoom slot that requires a computer and due to a fucked laptop screen hes hoping for a place with a TV.\nIt’s pretty tight but we make it; no spare screen though so I give him my computer for the call and enjoy his radiant energy and love for treeeeeees from two floors up; I’m frankly laughing my ass off as I consider the porters perspective of this spectacle because Jimi’s in the lobby positioned about 2 ft from the front desk and emphatically onboarding folks for an attempt at the Guinness world record. This would probably be a bit annoying if it were for some less quirky cause but since it’s for most trees planted in a day it’s probably quite resonant with the Aurovillian ethos!\n\nEntering the international zone\nIn the morning we pack up our stuff and head for coffee in the visitors centre thates only a few minuites walk away the international zone. As I’m checking out the information boards Rishi signals my attention to say that he belives he just spotted a rather mysterious acquaintance of ours called Manoj; a mystic that once graced an equinox gathering we organised in 2020!\nAs if to confirm the intuition, my phone unexpectedly started playing some Gurdjieff DeHartmann tunes and we make haste to say hello to our suspect. Indeed it is Manoj; he’s moving extremely slowly as if carrying a lot of mental weight. As we depart from the interaction I let the friend who introduced us know - who it turns out had just been on an ayahuasca journey the night before and had synchronistically seen Manoj (or someone that looked like him) within his visions.\n\nAs we depart, Jimi books us all places at the “BonGipsy eco-hut stay” a hippie haunt that costs about a fiver each. On first appearances its a pretty interesting environment but something’s up; I feel a heeeeeavy drag of tamas energy. Damn; this place is an energetic black hole… we struggle to even drive out the gates due to unhelpful helpers engaging the lads and distracting them at every turn and I begin to feel like I’m in a zombie movie.\nAs we stop at the beach I realise just how agitated I am from the experience and tell the lads there’s no way in hell I’m staying there so we move into the Unearth Hostel for a night. It’s a nicer spot, and also ran by complete stoners - though this time helpfully unhelpful folk that are quite independent and not looking to feed on the brains of their new arrivals.\nWishing to book a meditation in the Matrimandir, myself and Jimi head off to look for the famous golden egg. Instead we end up rather lost and while checking google maps for directions a seemingly friendly bull decides to headbutt Jimi. A couple of passing girls laugh at this ask if were lost, like I mean no shit, but it turns out that they are in a similar position and looking for a sound healing session. As this sounds better than searching out a booking office that’s probably closed, we decide to join them instead for this excursion instead. Turns out to be a good choice.\n\nYeah, we’re lost.\nUpon arrival we’re invited to lie down comfortably, close our eyes and just let ourselves to be. If movement surfaces in our bodies, just honour it gently. It’s a stereoscopic spree of polyphonic harmonics; instruments of all varieties played in the full sound scape of the auditorium. Real life surround sound. As I allowed my consciousness to drift around the various elements, I sensed a number of crystalline brain structures dissolving in the layer cake of neutral semantic energy, evaporating from my body in the form of tears. More lachromony, this time of a subtle variety.\nReturning back to the Unearth Hotel we’re recommended a nearby cafe for food where we can have dinner, make use of the internet and take various calls. An old peer calls me out of the blue; he’s now hacking banks as a white hat and serendipitously wishes to hook me up with a cryptographer friend that’s been training him in.\nYes please mate, that sounds great - though I’m a little concerned he’s now hacking banks… I’m pleased to hear that he’s finally got comfortable employment that suits him well as a white hat; though such a skill set could be a double edged sword as he could very easily end up as public enemy number one if he happens into hard times again… he’s grown up on the worst estate of the UK monopoly board and is consequentially unfused about the moralities of normative society; perfect red team material as white hat - hopefully it goes well and lasts!\nRishi sends me some stuff that the NAO folks are doing on “Greencheck” identity; really cool way of doing sibyl proof humanity. Framed in the context of previous work a picture really starts to paint itself. Brad also seems to recognise the overlaps and enthusiastic to do some work together; I guess I’ll have to write up a synthesis of all this identity stuff at some point soon. In the meanwhile we send each other various pieces of work and notes.\nJash, an old friend of Rishis, arrives in the evening and gifts me a creative artefact they both worked on that’s truly exxxxceeelllent!! Like a sign from the chaosmos its a synchronicity that’s far too weird to be causal in any linear or causal way; there’s a letter enclosed that seems to pertain to my time at the Regen Foundation suggesting that my hesitancy in action has completely sunken a boat… yes; this is a rather schizoid association to make but seriously WTF!!? It just gets weirder everyday…\n\n\nIt just gets weirder everyday…\nThanks for descending this far, yeah - we are now in the belly of the beast so you might consider checking out the next part of the story for upward momentum and resolve as it’s the best part of the Auroville journey!\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/travel/indiapt2/","title":"India 2: Bangalore","description":null,"body":"\nWith no plans laid out post Green Pill Festival; myself and Rishi drove overnight to Bangalore in order to get his new lady friend Aaba to hospital and back home.\nThe most likely scenario was that she had a stomach bug from nibbling on a kiwi fruit that was in turn nibbled on by a rat; while speculative, this situation seems pretty plausible given there were apparently two other run-ins with rodents that evening while we were on the road down…\nJimi ended up needing rabies shots due to a bite on his finger; while Marco awoke up to something fuzzy on his leg which he promptly kicked into the roof making an audibly large thud - as there was no body was identified it seems likely a rodent who somehow survived the impact. Ouch.\n\nBesides these events, all parties made it to Bangalore good spirits and met up for coffee after a good nights rest. Sino, Marco, Rishi, Jimi and myself met with Jacob and his lovely co-founder to learn about local design, indigenous crafts and supply chains before geeking out on blockchain economics. By and large this discussion was a demonstrative means to confer the value of diagrammatic reasoning and conversation graphs.\nAfter a Thursdays internetting with Rishi and Sino we decide to try and visit a temple together. Departing the coffee shop I receive a message from Jacob saying he’s interested in the excursion and walking towards us from his part of town. Detouring to pick him up at a restaurant we discover that the clock has already struck midnight and the temple is closing imminently. Cest la vie.\n“New plan; let’s head to Atlantis HQ and grab Marco”. Pinging him and others about our vector we receive no response and head over anyway only to discover that no one’s in. “Oh yeah they’re probably out for dinner with Sudebi and Probal”… “How do you guys feel about an escape room?” proposes Jacob, who’s suggestion passes almost instantly.\nOhhohoho, another portal summoning the forces of charoder! Myself, Rishi, Jacob and Sino make a pretty awesome team as we naturally fall into appropriate roles. The high stimulus environment of blaring white noise and strobe lights has Sino pretty agitated though… and I’m handcuffed to his side!\nWithin minutes, Rishi and Jacob are completely free of their chains and we get to work on a perspex puzzle that turns off the white noise generator; sweet relief! Its rather odd to still have the strobe light going but we get that off too; immediately Sino spots a key hanginging rather inconspicously by the speaker and were through the shutters into the next room.\nWhat were all those number-plates about then? no bloody idea, I drop it and start to stare at a poster full of guns with code names and try to find a pattern as others work on a cryptic flow chart that opens up the next door… A shelf, items, some math on the back of a door and a computer…. “okay, what are we supposed to do with these?” I wonder.\nOh ok, the computer requires a password and that seems to be a code associated with one of the guns I was looking at. The lads are about to crack the shelving puzzle which determines the reference code for the gun.\nGot it, its AK3080 (or something). A song with gun shots… ok, count them? right - yeah that’s the next door code. Home straight indeed now lads; what’s this map of India all about? Yeah the string goes round all these posts for some reason… but which ones and why? Ohhh, back to the number plates at the beginning for the layouts…\nYES Sino! Spot on, your right, it looks exactly like the symbol on all the props; what an interesting hermeneutic reference! X marks the spot so the Bangalore number plate is the final code? Clank, yup, we’re outta here! Drinks?\n\nFriday we’re invited to Utkarsh’s place in the evening so we call in a little early to do some co-working in with him and his friend Scooby. This takes us into a discussion on $Earthcoin, its tokenomics and general mechanism design. Jimi, working on a proposal in the other room periodically buzzes in and out to test his thinking and from there the conversation turns to bonding curves and liquidity pools.\nAs we put the white board away a number of the Green Pill Festie folk start to show up at the house along with their various partners and girlfriends. The party’s a little fragmented but also relatively civil given there were freeskates and slacklines available to cause accidents! Ever the dry shite, I head home at about 1am to get some rest.\n\n\nSaturday is April 1st and as usual I’m playing the fool; having toured the design school and beautiful market with Marko and Sino during the first half of the day I attempt to make it over to a Polkadot event which is supposedly happening in the Sheraton hotel; I just happen to go to the wrong one… With the correct address an hour across town it seems the event will close by the time I arrive; I subsequently admit defeet (gettit?) and decide to look for shoes around the nearby shopping mall.\nBump! - “Oh hello Sino,, fancy seeing you again haha! Marcos in Starbucks? Ok, cool - I’ll drop in for a moment to say hi. Hola mate, me again; get anything done? yeah I’ll try a sweet, what are they? mmm they’re are a little bitter sweet just like my day haha! Right, you guys are gonna do some shopping? I’ll stay here for some coffee and writing. See you back here in an hour or so.”\nAfter an reasonably extensive writing session I wonder where they disappeared to, check a group chat and discover movement being planned across town… “Ok yeah, I’ll head over to the restaurant club thing you lot are meeting at”.\nJumping in a rickshaw I ask the price. The driver says 2000 rupee; so I say forget it and begin to get out as it cost me 400 to get over so I figure it should be about the same back. The driver begins to haggle with me and we settle on 500. A few minutes later a change of venue comes in over the telegram and coordinates are actually closer, so I update the driver and he’s good with it - or so I believe. As we arrive at my destination he tries charge 2000 again…\nWe go back and forward on this as he’s intent on getting whatever he can and I’m intent on a reasonable and fair outcome. He tries a number of approaches including shame and anger, calling me a cheater and so forth which is all rather unpleasant so I give him the 5oo and angrily point to a cop car to settle things. His tone changes to panicked and rather weak so I give him another 100 to close the matter in sympathy.\nGuru and Utkarsh arrive after a short wait in the restaurant, who upon hearing about my kerfuffle laugh and suggest that “it shoulda been 200 dude - book through Uber, the drivers always try to rip us off too!”.\nA number of others begin to arrive in convoy now but as Marcos in shorts the venue refuses him entry so we decide to leave. Jimi has already hit the dance floor so we grab him and get into Utkarsh’s car and set off for a more local social club they frequent.\nAs we pull out of the car park we pass the others and suddenly drivers start to changing, people are rotating in and out of the car as logistics are figured out and after a little bit of turbulence and we’re on our way again. Dubstep on the radio, we somehow pass the others in a rickshaw… and then promptly leave them for dust.\nAs we arrive, I reflect on the novelty of dropping the car off to the valet; a privilege I’ve never experienced before - probably because I’ve never had my own wheels or the cash to rent a car while visiting foreign countries - so it feels a bit like entering a James Bond casino in an odd kinda way.\nEntry fee covers drinks and being a dry shite I don’t need them so Guru kindly pays my entry and redistributes the tokens; the place is pretty dope place. Way less flashy than the place we left in order to get here but more fun and quirky; it’s layout actually reminds me of a night club I used to tech manage.\nAfter about an hour the others travelling by rickshaw arrive just in time to get booted out for close. Myself and Rishi were gonna stay with Irthu but feeling pretty tired I wish them all a good night and set off to find myself a hotel as they move on to party. Finding a spot is less easy than expected but after checking a few non existent locations on google maps I stumble across the same hotel I checked out of in the morning in order to complete a perfect circle!\n\nSunday is pretty graceful; I grab a coffee at my regular spot ‘talk over table’ and then head over to visit Irthu. Something really starts to light up as we jam on cosmology and myths of creation and after a while he asks me what LunarPunk Labs is doing…\nAvoiding transcendental narratives to explain the mystery I’m swimming through I suggest ‘what’ is the wrong question as it’s generated from the ‘how’. He beams at this answer and recommends a book called ‘draw to win’ - oh yeah that lands.\nScrawling all over the desk he begins to share the Atlantean vision and his backstory of working with Mercy Corp. Holy fuck - he’s actually been there and totally legit; they were solving issues around the Indian water supply for years and actually got pretty far before pissing off some mafiosa, which forced them to close their company for safety reasons. Decentralisation was a means of moving forward while spreading the risk.\nThe vision and narrative vibed for me but ever the pragmatist their crew history impressed me most; they’d been practising various forms of solidarity while co-living and getting their hands dirty. Irthu shared a number of designs patterns informed from their experience and the ontology was pretty tight. Super general and useable across numerous projects.\n\nAs a disassociated technologist I’ve been going pretty meta to avoid opinionation while working at a functional level in my own designs as those closest to the problem are best suited to solve it. Ever hesitant to prescribe a particular ontology for this reason I’m glad to finally stumble into a set of opinions that actually count for something rather than some Refi marketing hype espoused by innocent fools who by and large have become brainwashed instruments of the ‘network state’.\nDiscussion continues into all kinds of subject matter often considered taboo or woowoo and my flame begins to burn brighter. Irthu has rather interesting edge that’s as explorative as my own and is just as sceptical. Seems we both love to run pattern analysis on novel perspectives when they come from a place of curiosity rather than ideology (too blackpilled to eat more of that!).\n\nThere’s a healthy scepticism present in our convo but were also faaaar off piste into the free field of potentiality; ahh sweet refreshment. This is the type of interaction where the impossible suddenly seems to become possible; balanced flow in a far from equilibrium states… cause, choice, change!\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/travel/indiapt1/","title":"India 1: Gorkana","description":null,"body":"\nOver the precipice once again; searching for god knows what I jump a flight to Atlantis… I mean to Gokarna to meet Rishi in person for the first time; despite having shared a lot of time together online during the COVID period.\nHe’d met the Atlantis team at Refi Bangalore who were convening a gathering called “green pill festival”; a retreat for founders and hackathon builders. We stayed here for a week hanging out with their crew while workshopping our way forward into the unknown.\n\nArriving after 26 hours of travel I crashed out twice, only to awake at 4am in a jet lagged delirium before going for for a walk in the darkness to shake the fog. The atmospheres mysterious and electric, with chants vibrating through the air from across a nearby field. I attempt a search out the noise but am unable to locate the source so decide to vocalise in resonance instead while setting out for a walk across the beach. Suddenly there’s scuttling all round my feet; zippity clacky clack ziiiiiiiip - what the hell are these funky creatures? They’re fast as lightning and under the darkness of new moon it’s impossible to discern.\nFollowing another cycle of rest, I’m woken from a knock at my door; answering in my underwear I’m briefly introduced to an unexpected room mate that I’ll be sharing space with who’s name is Raj. “Come on in man, get yourself sorted - about time I got up anyway”. Another knock, this time Kieran from the Atlantis team. “Do you wanna do some yoga?” he asks, “Great timing, yeah, that’s just what I was thinking about” - “Ok then, its happening in ten minutes over on the beach!”\nAt this stage I’m feeling pretty much recovered from all the sleep and exercise and now realise what the night scuttlers were; crabs coming out of their burrows under cover of the new moon during low tide. As we do sun salutations on the sand a number of jokes are cracked about them emerging only to bite asses.\nOn my way back to shower, I cross paths with Guru who’s a little concerned about the retreats programming and facilitation so offer a hand. We sit down to sequence and embellish the workshops he’s put together and I’m thoroughly impressed by the containers developed based on Wilburs integral theory (essentially a western appropriation of Aurobindos work). As it turns out, I’ve little to contribute to the programme other than a few loose ideas as the workshops are set and well sequenced; the best I can offer is some reassurance in hopes of relieving pressure.\nUtkarsh tangentially joins us at the table and we talk about the contextual realities surrounding regeneration and the forces that need to be confronted. It’s refreshing to have a break from narratives as we dive into market jujitsu; he really gets this and over the rest of the week the two of us share a number of discussions; feet in the water we discuss cosmology, markets, science, technology, ideology and spirituality.\n\nWithout needing to say anything much there’s a lot of resonance; our discussions are essentially pleasant verbalisations due to the novel sense of complementarity. We share and learn. One particular gem he informs me of is that the Vedics leveraged their precise cosmology to record historical events against planetary movements as a means of verification; more cosmological logistics!\nAs the weeks workshops play out the facilitators hold space well despite our open environment presenting distractions like the nearby juice stall. We dive into communication practices with Jacob from Terregeneration; a gentle soul who spent several years of his life cleaning up a mountain he and his partner moved to. As attention wanes with the approaching sunset other facilitator types like Didi step in to heard the cats and keep the timings on course.\n\nAs the light begins to fade with sunset over sea I spend a bit of time juggling which opens up a conversation with Jacob. In the meanwhile, Utkarsh playfully steals a stray ball and disappears with it probably believing his actions have gone unnoticed which leaves Jacob mildly nonplussed, informing me that “someone” has taken the prop. As our conversation winds down Utkarsh appears from the darknesse to reveal himself as the thief and return it as a fellow agent of balanced chaorder!\nThe final workshop is pure gold. It’s a role playing game called “its just business” which leads to outright chaos. Participants are enrolled into a ficticious scenario regarding a fictional island and asked to inhabit roles within this multi-stakeholder ecosystem; there’s an international airline looking to capitalise on tourism, the local government, fishermen, conservationists, youth, elders and such.\nAs we go about negotiations with eachother the occasional news flash is broadcast regarding the state of international affairs - which in turn changes the political dynamics. After the negotiation stage we return to a plenary session in order to articulate each groups positions to the government, who makes a final call on what’s to happen while simultaneously trying to stay in power by appeasing all parties.\nOhhohoho man, this is when things got as fragmented as the house of commons during Brexit; there was tons of booing, hissing and an almighty racket as the various factions fought over their values. It was brutal and many of the representatives were genuinely rattled by the uproar and froze. The youth were particularly disruptive having made an alliance with the airlines (who having dismissed the fishermen had “we’ve got boats” repeatedly chanted at them - yes guilty, that was me)…\nFinally the government made their decision to allow the airport and were unanimously voted out of power - even by the airlines - who as it turns out, had embraced corruption by impersonating the government in order to achieve their ends! What a bloody mess… but thankfully only a simulation! You can’t win them all.\nThe ‘business’ consortium\n\nSunday is our day in Gorkana and a few special guests are passing through to see whats happening.

The first principals he surfaced are foundational to a number of related theories like spiral dynamics and integrates many others. If your interested in the field you should probably start here before looking at other work as its one of the more robust and reliable.\n\nIntroduction\nThis article basically acts as an exposition to highlight my investigations into the work of Clare Graves, a New York psychology professor who brought the world an evidence based meta-model known as Emergent Cyclical Theory.\nHis work is salient to me due to its broad utility and explanatory power that’s capable of integrating a plethora of existing theories as well as clarifying a lot of confusion around various existential questions; in a nutshell it’s a great lens to lean on when making sense of the world!\nFor many of us society can seem rife with fragmentation and contradictory views due to our heterogeneous and pluralistic nature. Gazing through this kaleidoscope of world views it’s hard not to get lost in the fractal and such chaorder can feel extremely unpredictable, arbitrary and uncertain at times.\nThis artefact thus originates from a personal desire to discern order from chaos. Are there constants in the complexity of values that drive human behaviour? my own conjecture here is basically yes but that discussion is out of scope. For now we are going to look at vertical integration and skip out on the horizontal axis.\nGraves’ work is grounded in inquiry rather than hypothesis and highlights the importance of an unfolding evolutionary process rather than the static models and prescriptions often found in other psychological literature. Many of these theories do indeed contain grains of truth but let us momentarily pause here to note that there many castles made out of sand. There is no one ring to rule them all.\nI’ll endeavour not to mislead you but please note that I’m what you might call an epistemic trespasser in the waters of psychology so please engage your critical faculties and do your best to remember that “the map is not the territory!”\nFirstly, I’m gonna prime you with some asides on the theory and then lead you through it’s history and background. After that, I’ll get down and dirty with the framework and detail some of the research Graves explicated. Then we’ll discuss the underlying process which drives the model and I’ll add some reflections regarding its significance and potential use. Last, I’ll add some of my own experiences and some commentary before concluding the essay. Enjoy!\nAn Essential Open Inquiry\nEMT came perilously close to remaining a buried treasure when Graves witnessed his friend and colleague Abraham Maslow unceremoniously “torn to pieces” by colleagues at an APA seminar in the mid 1950’s. He subsequently vowed to never put himself into a similar situation until he could adequately defend his own position; a rather difficult task that ultimately led him to obscurity rather than fame. Credit to him, he was rigorous and did the work.\nMuch of this work was later abandoned out of frustration and the book he was working on remained unpublished until after his death. Only later was it posthumously pieced back together again by peers and archivists digging through his remaining articles, transcripts and seminars.\nFor me, one of the most salient parts of this theory is that it considers the human condition as open-ended with no final state of enlightenment, self-actualization or nirvana. These states may indeed exist but the evidence seems to favour an endless search for order in a chaotic universe without an ultimate finality.\nEventually the more famous Abraham Maslow embraced Graves’ open-ended view despite many common interpretations of his work:\n\nYou should know that Maslow came around to my point of view. If you look at his later writings you will see that he accepted both the cyclic idea that there is more than one kind of expressive system and more than one kind of belonging system, and the system is open ended. We finally, after fighting this over for eight years, came to a fundamental agreement along that line. - Graves (Lee, 2002,  p. 52)\n\nThe essence of Graves’ work is that humans develop new bio-psycho-social coping mechanisms to deal with existential problems, and these emergent coping mechanisms arise in response to an increasingly complex environment. As the tide of human progress rises exponentially, it may be that we’ll begin to encounter more so called Buddhas about. Or face existential ruin…\n⚠️ For those who have already done a degree of reading around Spiral Dynamics, or Ken Wilbur etc, please do your best NOT to draw comparisons just yet. These works are all indeed very similar and also related but I’m deliberately avoiding discussion on these authors because they draw FROM this foundational work and conflating them may lead to confusion ⚠️\nHistory\nIn the early 1950’s Graves held a position as a psychology professor at Union College NY where a student of his posited the following question: from all the competing psychological theorists, whose model was ultimately correct?\nWith no immediate answer to hand, and a monkey on his back, Graves could only start collecting the data required to find out!\nHe began with the following lines of inquiry:\n\nCan one provide evidence that conflict and contradiction, confusion and controversy are represented in conceptions of psychological health?\nWhat are the conceptions of psychological health existing in the minds of biologically mature human beings?\nDo the concepts which exist suggest that psychological health should be viewed:\n\n(a) as a state or condition, or\n(b) as a psychological process?\n\n\nWhat is the essential nature of psychological health if it is a state or condition?\nWhat is the nature of the process of psychological health if the basic research indicates that it should be viewed thus?\n\nThese drivers were then further expanded into research questions in order to generate relevant data:\n\nHow do biologically mature human beings conceive of ‘what is the healthy personality’?\nDo biologically mature humans have, basically, one major identifiable conception of what the psychologically healthy adult is?\nDo biologically mature humans have more than one conception of what a healthy personality is?\nIf adults have several conceptions of healthy personality, are the conceptions classifiable into groups of similar conceptions?\nIf the various conceptions are classifiable, how can they be classified?\n\n\n(a) by content?\n(b) structurally?\n(c) functionally?\n\n\nWill there be evidence that a singular conception of healthy personality stands out as superior to other conceptions?\n\nThe primary issue surmised:\nWhat will be the nature and character of conceptions of psychological health of biologically mature human beings who are intelligent, but relatively unsophisticated in psychological knowledge in general, and in personality theory in particular?\nWith these formulations, Graves set out to conduct his research which unfolded in approximately four phases: Data Collection, Classification, Observation and Interpretation.\nPhase 1: Primary Data Collection\nAt the beginning of Graves’ investigation he was working in three schools (note three levels of recursion); one all male, another all female and the last was a mixed adult extension division. Over the course of his research he studied a relatively diverse group of about 1,065 subjects aged 18-61.\nHe needed ‘representative’ subjects for the purposes of his study; which he found in his relatively unsophisticated first year students that were enrolled on his “Theory of Normal Psychology” program. The classroom became a laboratory where he taught in ‘novel’ ways to accommodate his study while applying his methodology to eight sets of students, eight seperate times in order to generate his primary data set.\nUpon starting his lectures, he told his students not to read a single thing on psychology for the first five classes. The time was to be spent discussing what one might put into a conception of healthy personality and a personal conception was to be presented in a paper at the end of the first five weeks.\nIn the second set of five weeks, students were split into random groups and instructed to present their personal conceptions to peers and receive criticism. Graves observed their reactions and behaviours as their peers “went after them” with critique of their espoused conception.\nAt the end of the second interval of five weeks, students were asked to write up a defence or modification of their existing conception. This gave Graves a chance to observe if and how conceptions changed under peer influence.\nIn a third and final interval of five weeks, the class studied a variety of authorities and again turned in a modification of their original hypotheses. Graves then sat with randomly selected students to interview them about the process itself; how might their conceptions have changed and what were the factors that influenced them in changing their minds?\nThis data set produced:\n\nA large set of beliefs around the conception of a healthy psychology.\nReactions to the criticism of espoused beliefs, evidenced in observation and through paper defence and/or modification.\nRelation to confrontation with authority as evidenced through paper defence or modification.\nInterview data on the process of the primary experience.\n\nThrough this study, a second set of research questions opened up:\n\nWhat will happen to a person’s characterization of mature human behaviour when s/he is confronted with the criticism of his/her point of view by peers who have also developed their own conception of psychologically mature behaviour?\nWhat will happen to a person’s conception of mature human behaviour when confronted with the task of comparing and contrasting his/her conception of psychologically mature human personality to those conceptions which have been developed by authorities in the field?\nHow will the subjects behave under peer criticism?\n\nPhase 2: Classification\n⚠️ Note: Graves later reversed his lettering format; the first letter is for conditions, second for neurology ⚠️\nDiscernment and Differentiation\nYear after year an external panel of judges were instructed to classify the data into categories. This process was then blindly repeated by a second panel of judges - as per good science.\nThe data points repeatedly collapsed into two primary categories:\n\nExpress self; primarily motivated by internal forces.\nDeny self; predominantly driven by external forces.\n\nAs these two categories emerged each year (unknown to the panel) the research turned into a process of accumulation. Over 8 years, sub-categories also began to emerge in about 60% of the data. This data was later augmented and interpreted through further research in phase four of Graves’ inquiry.\nThe primary categories, the labels of which will be expanded on later, and the basic traits of the participants’ conceptions are as follows:\n\nDeny self:\n\n\na) sacrificially - Aka [BO].\nb) for deferred reward - Aka [DQ].\nc) for acceptance now - Aka [FS].\n\n\nExpress self:\n\n\na) as self desires in a calculating fashion, at the expense of others - Aka [ER].\nb) as self desires but not at the expense of others - Aka [GT].\n\nPhase 3: Observation of Interactions\nWith formalised classifications, Graves was now able to study his accumulated data and observations in depth. This was probably the most interesting phase of his study as it would reveal a good deal of information about how different conceptions tend to interact in the social field. It’s also where the situation began to turn into a somewhat more complex puzzle!\n\nThe first task was to study the formalised conceptions in relation to peer criticism as evaluated through a defence/modification of the conceptions espoused by a given subject - whether and how peer criticism influenced a subjects conception and the interaction patterns at play with peers in this process.\nThe second task was to study the formalised conceptions in relation to authoritative criticism as evaluated through a defence/modification of a subjects articulated conceptions - whether and how authoritative criticism influenced a subjects conception and the interaction patterns at play with authority in this process.\n\nBy diving into these fundemental interaction patterns the models of each conception were significantly enriched aiding the ongoing discernment process outlined in phase 2; why did it seem that there were such radical differences in the same “primary conceptions”?\nAs a quick revision, the similarities in the primary conceptions were:\n\nSacrificial conceptions were responsive to external conditions. They saw denial of self and degrees of conformity as the answer to their existential conditions.\nExpressive conceptions were NOT responsive to external conditions. They saw self expression as a means to overcome their existential conditions but would move into deny-self modalities when “central change” (movement to other modalities) occurred.\n\nThe subject of importance here was the difference between subjects occupying similar conceptions, particularly for enumerating and enhancing resolution on the subcategories. These findings are summarised below.\nDifferences between sacrificial conceptions:\nSome of the deny-self conceptions were dissimilar in relation to their effective change force. Certain subjects (the [DQ] conception) would respond only to an accepted higher authority and NOT their peers, remaining rigid and otherwise defending their initial conceptions to the last. Others however (the [FS] conception) would respond only to peer authority and NOT a perceived higher power. The two classifications were also quite dissimilar in terms of their perceived behavioural freedoms.\nDifferences between expressive conceptions:\nThe express-self conceptions were also quite different in terms of effective change forces. A number of subjects (the [ER] conceptions) would change only through self procured sources, while others (the [GT] conceptions) seemed to respond regardless of where a thought or information originated from.\nThese conceptions were also dissimilar in terms of perceived behavioural freedoms. Certain subjects (the [ER] conceptions) “always expressed themselves as if tethers were on them, always tying them down”, while others (the [GT] conception) didn’t feel bound to anything much at all - especially the goals of others. These subjects were generally non-argumentative but would often interject about perceived mistakes.\nGroup Work:\nWith increased resolution on the subcategories; students with the same conceptions of psychological maturity were grouped into classes and tasked with a specific problem. These subjects were then left to autonomously form groups and students with a…\n• [DQ] conception split up into small feudalistic units, each with separate leaders.\n• [ER] conception had a huge argument, with one eventual leader emerging.\n• [FS] conception worked well on their own without a leader.\n• [GT] conception chose the most appropriate leader for the task at hand and later to drop them for someone better suited for the next task.\nPhase 4: Outliers and Interpretation\nThe last phase was spent interpreting the data through research and factoring in world views from other non-industrialised cultures. These walks of life were were probably factored in to avoid immediacy bias.\nAround this time a new category also started to emerge as up until this point the available data seemed to point towards a final stage of psychological maturity… but a number of people with the ‘express self but without cost to the others’ conception began to reject their previous world views! This contradiction shook Graves’ work at its foundations and for a short time caused him a great deal of confusion.\nAfter the occurrence of these anomalies, people from working classes also began to gain access to higher education and it became evident that an earlier sub-category had been missed out; a remorseless ‘express self at all costs’ modality whom appeared to hold a ‘law of the jungle’ mentality where ‘might is right’.\nThis remorseless [CP] conception was thus the most primordial Graves collected in his primary sample, though as mentioned prior stages of cognitive evolution were later uncovered through anthropological research.\nThe subjects of this [CP] conception (‘express self mercilessly at all costs’) began to shift in their beliefs, lo and behold, into the already documented conception of ‘deny self for later reward’!\nThus in one stroke the earlier anomaly of [GT] subjects denying their own prior conceptions was also resolved; they had undergone a process of central change and were starting to embrace a yet inconceived modality. Subsequently, these findings paved the way for psychological health to be viewed as a process rather than fixed state.\nThis new category [HU] was as far Graves’ primary data went but he and a number of others believed that it wasn’t the end of the journey! Given how old this research is already paired with the rising complexity of our environment, we may now once again be witnessing the birth of a new conception not listed on the 1974 chart above; the [IV] modality. Graves speculated the progression was a ‘six on six ladder’ or octave – so keep an eye out!\nThe Dialectical Ladder\nSo far we’ve just reviewed the history of the research and how the conceptions were formed. At this point we can now begin to cover the topic more generally while trying to elicit some insights. The classifications are probably still a bit unclear so let’s quickly cover those in more depth.\nThe first set of characters in Graves’ notation system [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H] refer to “existential conditions’’ or the environment in which we inhabit. While the second set of characters [N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U] refer to what Graves termed “emergent coping mechanisms” – the capabilities we leverage to transcend our environments.\nThese emergent cycles might be thought of as a swinging pendulum where we oscillate between express-self and deny-self modalities in an unfolding process. What I find particularly interesting about the implications of Graves classifications is the generative dialectic between environment and organism.\nTo me, this dialectic feels like the difference between aspiration and embodied action; the environmental context gives rise to a set of needs or desires, which are then slowly manifested through a form of abductive reasoning embodied in new and novel behaviours. Like an octopus:\n\nGraves later revised the [GT] and [HU] conceptions to [AN’] and [BO’] as he theorised a ‘six on six ladder’. He did so because these later conceptions closely resembled the earliest stages with a post-subsistance twist.\nIn contrast to the Gravesian symbol system of letter pairings; the colours, categories and “value-memes” typically reified in Spiral Dynamics and related materials seem to grossly overlook this generative interplay, reducing it into a static typing system – something that I personally find unhelpful. This focus on static categories is a reductive fallacy that has often been used to claim higher ground and author legitimacy narratives. In my opinion Graves avoids this pitfall by maintaining a focus on dialectic and process.\nGenerative Friction\nAs you might imagine – there can be quite a tension between existential conditions and the formation of ‘emergent coping mechanisms’. This friction is perhaps akin to the myth of Sisyphus pushing a boulder uphill for all of eternity. Once a local maximum is reached in this seemingly open ended system, the boulder rolls back down again to a new local minimum. Once more we begin work on our next existential challenge!\nSo, having now acquainted ourselves with the various psychological conceptions; and more importantly the process of structural coupling which occurs between actor and environment, the most interesting questions (for me) become:\n\nwhat actually occurs during this generative process of transformation?\nand how do such bio-psycho-social phase shifts happen?\n\nLets zoom in on the transformative process as articulated by Graves:\n1. Potential\nThe necessary “higher order structures” must be present within the organism – which Graves saw as neurological systems within the brain. Unfortunately, further resolution on this matter has eluded me during the course of my Gravesian investigations.\nDąbrowski’s work on positive disintegration may be relevant however. Here he points to the factors of over-excitability, personal capabilities and drive for autonomy as significant factors in the development of an “independent personality”. At the organisational level, we might speculate that these structures could be represented by the variety of people, rituals, values, coordination protocols, practices and memetics available within a group or environment.\n2. Resolution of existential problems\nStages of expanding (and contracting) awareness cannot be skipped or bypassed. Problems faced at earlier stages of existence must be resolved in order to release psychic energy for advance. First things first!\n3. Feelings of dissonance\nA breakdown of solutions to one’s immediate existential problems MUST be faced along with a period of crisis and regression. The dissonance of this situation is required to catalyse biochemical changes that drive a regressive search for old patterns of behaviour in order to establish a previous apparent solution to the situation. Such a search is certain to end in arrestment, regression or growth as old solutions to previous problems DO NOT apply to the new context any better than the way of life whose inadequacy triggered the initial search. This might be considered a form of psychological bifurcation.\n4. Gaining of insights\nPutting an end to the regressive search, unlocking the formation of new structures and propelling an evolution to the next modality, is insight. This insight MUST enable the organism to find an equilibrium in the immediate environment.\n5. Removal of barriers\nWhen this insight is reached, few in the environment will share the same understanding and thus the barriers of friends, family, processes etc. must be overcome or ignored to make a leap.\n6. Opportunity to consolidate\nThe last necessary condition for the emergence of new structures is a consolidation factor which comes into play as the organism begins to practice and affirm the new behaviour. Here the implementation of insights are being achieved and accomplished.\nAt this point I feel compelled to speculate that uncovering this transformative process is probably where Graves got most stuck, leading to delays publishing his work and frustrations mentioned at the beginning of this article. To my senses the above list is a rough hexad within and animating the enneagram of process - though I doubt Graves personally realised this. My own belief is that that this would prove a fruitful line of inquiry for anyone looking to enrich Graves’ work as the non-linear temporalities reveal a lot about the transformative journey. The apokritikal levels of being that Graves describes as psychological modalities were not unfamiliar to Sufi schools and other mystery traditions.\nEngaging with transformation\nOk, so now having grokked the various conceptions and the deeper process of transformation; how do we leverage this understanding? Can it be used to help us judge appropriate actions in a given context to empower both ourselves and other individuals while navigating transition? What insights might really help us help us to flourish?\nPerhaps the first key is to accurately diagnose the terrain we’re traversing before figuring out what’s needed and/or desired before prioritising an appropriate pattern, schema or modality to enables us to overcome the obstacles in our way?\nLet’s sample a selection of potentially useful approaches:\nIn most modern cultures, the [AN] and [BO] stages are primarily found in toddlers. Learning is through habituation and essentially Pavlovian conditioning; an associative linear process whereby stimulus provokes a response. The classic example is a dog drooling while its dinner is being prepared, but the same process also applies in large to dementia and substance addiction (e.g. a junkie searching out a bag of heroin).\nFor a loose cannon at the [CP] stage, benevolent autocracy is perhaps warranted? This might perhaps sound draconian but given complete freedom inhabitants of this modality will absorb as much space as possible while openly fleecing others of their agency; if you give an inch, they’ll take a mile. Graves references B.F. Skinner, August Aichhorn and Kurt Eisler as relevant therapies stating “you put this person in a box psychologically and you don’t let him out. You’ve got to know and accept those rules!”. Most subsistence modalities will have immense difficulties dealing with this conception due to the limitations of their own ontology.\nWorking with the [DQ] stage, Graves suggests Freud is pretty much the only person who ever had a clue. These subjects need gentle hand-holding and a personal relationship in order to overcome their fears, break down unhelpful positions and foster trust… thereafter moving along at a snail’s pace to lead them back into a sense of embodied self. These people need to see the engaging party as an acceptable authority figure or they’ll remain hidden in their shell without conceding an inch.\nThe [ER] modalities gain insight only from what they can procure for themselves, gauging their expectations against outcomes. In this regard encounter groups where people gather to express felt experiences arising out of personal interactions are good places to receive useful feedback. Worth noting here however is if the (out) group is unknown to the [ER] centred psychology it would seem that they will often observe and leverage the weakness of others members of the group to exploit and instrumentalise them. They need to interact with a known group with real stakes and repercussions.\nFor those centred in an [FS] modality, Graves held that the Rodgerian approach was “a very fine one”. Many of these methods are similar to the [ER] interventions minus the training wheels of a known group. Particular methods such as the Rodgerean Argument he seemed to consider more suitable than others. As the [FS] modality has embarked on a journey of self-exploration they are predominantly asking “why?” questions which means than an authentic and congruent 1:1 relationship facilitates deeper inquiry and shared context.\nWe’ll stop here as [GT] and [HU] conceptions are open on all channels, learning from every encounter and situation. The main difference between these modes is the maturity; [GT] often seeming to be a kind of potential junkie, and maybe [HU] as somewhat more cautious.\nReflections\nWhile writing this document and in the course of my own journey, I can say that the conceptions feel quite accurate and extremely useful tools of perception and diagnostics. Schemas are not something I’ll ever really take for gospel but the framework does seem to diagnose past behaviours with relatively high degrees of accuracy; I can see a cycle of personal conceptions that have repeatedly arisen and broken down again while oscillating upon the carrier wave of my life:\nBO &gt; CP: The modality throughout my teenage years was clearly that of deny-self. Socialised mind did its best to fit in with kin spirits and fill a group niche. This semi-autistic version of myself was eventually perturbed into a sense of self-awareness via romantic rejection and teenage heartbreak.\nCP &gt; DQ: Later during my university years I moved into an express-self modality. I was ferociously exercising, writing music prolifically while dating regularly. At one point in this cycle a dear friend of mine got fed up with the impulsive behaviour and hit me with the statement “you can’t just keep talking over people man” the shame of which once again perturbed my world view.\nDQ &gt; ER: My early career seems to accurately fit a deny-self modality where I felt quite disembodied; watching myself in third person while smoking away external tensions as a form of escapism. I was working for a particularly imperialistic employer and the thought of further subordinating myself to such tyrannical authority was really grating on me so when the opportunity arose I quit my job and started a company of my own.\nER &gt; FS: As captain of my own ship I moved into an express-self modality; installing sound systems for several high end venues in London while also beginning to invest in speculative assets. I expanded into night club tech management and eventually burnt myself out on graveyard shifts – moving into a well paid technology job shortly thereafter. My calculated boundary pushing there provoked push back and brought down the wrath of others, eventually leading to being made redundant as the startup began to run out of funding in the great ETH crash of 2018. Yeah, I was a brat.\nFS &gt; GT: Leaving the world of employment behind to search out like minded peers seems to accurately reflect the “deny-self for acceptance now” conception; I joined a variety of self-organising initiatives and after some time found refuge in the countryside messing about with crypto robotics with a peer. The pace was slow and the location isolating so a sense of dissonance began to creep in; resultantly I was moved to affirm myself and began to seek stability on my own ground by taking a job as a Ledger Governance Coordinator and moving to Berlin before quickly pivoting to Lisbon instead.\nIt appears that many sources suggest that the FS &gt; GT transition is the hardest to work through. However, the reasoning for these assertions seem quite mysterious and thin on the ground and so I feel compelled to share my own experience of this transition. Stated bluntly the end of the green transition felt like I’d been stripped of all character leaving a whisper of core essence that was pretty unresponsive and completely spaced out. Veg mode.\nThe upside to that however was an honest sense of self-awareness which seemed to become a process of rebuilding my “avatar” in a systematic way from the ground up unintentionally taking on the properties of each stage that seemed to change about every three months or so. There was also a growing sense of self-acceptance (which I thought I’d already found) coming from an open disclosure of my internal world. This was probably the end of the FS stage.\nAutonomy and independence certainly came at a cost but life became both more colourful and difficult as I entered the GT stage; my experience of this transition was that the involution cycle felt pretty dark. The GT modality seems to be refilling on potential that previously withered away so a whole bunch of high capacity chaos cats seem to emerge and get real frigging tricky with each other.\nThere’s a sense of fear and paranoia among individuated peers while reality turns into a warzone as individuals competing for agency rug each other for the realisation of their potential… leading to the unitive HU transformation; though I honestly can’t quite comment on that part of the journey in detail just yet other than to say that I’m frigging exhausted from the involution cycle.\nCommentary\nWhile exploring and reflecting on this model, I’ve taken it with a pinch of salt and largely read between the lines. From this perspective it feels pretty solid and I honestly don’t have a huge amount of criticism to direct at in. Taking a more literal perspective however it seems that some of the terminology might benefit from minor adjustments in framing.\nIn particular Graves seems to frame the process from a lens of coping and problem solving which we might say is a form of goal orientation. This seems at odds with his otherwise predominant process orientation and so we can perhaps view the transitions as a process of healing from damage incurred in prior modalities.\nThroughout this article I’ve also been cautious not to call the conceptions “levels” – as many transcripts do – because such words can easily lead to a sense of elitism. This is rife in the Spiral Dynamics communities which draw upon this work and tends to turn many people off. Graves himself noted in a number of transcripts that “levels’’ were uncorrelated with intelligence and that it’s more a case of understanding how people do what they do, or how they believe what they believe.\nWhile it seems that the research methods were generally robust; the [AN] and [BO] conceptions were inferred through extensive study of anthropological literature as previously mentioned. This seems fair in the context of his study and a necessary step to avoid the immediacy bias of solely relying on his own sample; however by looking for conceptions outside his sample and finding them it opens the potential for confirmation bias. Ahh, the thin line and endless double bind!\nConclusion\nIt seems apparent to me at this point that Emergent Cyclical Theory has a wide range of implications across a number of fields; particularly in government, business, healthcare, education and social sciences. We might thereby consider it an aid for anticipating potential futures, or as a lens for systemic intervention - with the right eyes and ears it can help enable us to tailor an appropriate response to a given context and meet it in place with right (or deliberately wrong) action!\nFurthermore, Emergent Cyclical Theory seems pretty applicable to emerging fields like distributed ledger technology, artificial general intelligence and computer science - as they are all artefacts of our ontologyes and how we think.\nThese encoded ideologies are the products of our environmental coupling which then become concrete realities which shape the affordances of our daily lives. Having an awareness of what’s shaping us and the modality that created it is an incredibly important notion to be aware of… and perhaps even more so in the reverse; how we’re using our agency to shape the world and others around us is a deep ethical concern that we can probably all be more aware of. How are we contributing? What values are driving our actions and behaviour? How much hubris is involved?\nNavigating the tensions present in daily life feels analogous to matching voltage or impedence; wherever there’s an ontological mismatch there’s a energetic bottleneck that restricts flow and leaks potential. Stepping and blending these energetics is an art form I could personally use more practice in but having a good sense of where others are coming from is certainly helpful in attempting such alchemy!\nPerhaps beyond this is a notion of situationism; the conjuring of moments which enable us to grow in safe to fail environments at the collective scale. Performance events and circumstances which test our capacities and surface our ontologies for what they are; fragile beliefs, attachments and conditioned patterns. As Graves initially pondered; can exposure to confusion, contradiction, controversy and conflict help us to become better adapted to our existential environment? I personally believe so but buyer beware; this can be absolutely exhausting when sustained over long periods of time!\n“Buy the ticket, take the ride”\nAd Astra ✨,\njosh\n\nReading\n\nThe Never Ending Quest - Clare Graves\nSpiral Dynamics - Beck and Cowan\nA Brief History of Everything - Ken Wilbur\nModel of Hierarchical Complexity – Michael Commons\nPiaget\nLovinger\n\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/expositions/semiotics/","title":"Semiotics in Brief","description":null,"body":"\nIntroduction\nSemiotics is essentially the study of significance, or as it is often put the study of signs, signifiers and the signified. While no expert on Peirce, the patterns of his thinking seem to be foundational thinking within Bennetts theories on the qualitative significance of number, or Hodgsons Qualsystems/Qualitative Systems Thinking. Personally speaking, this is what makes Peirce’s work interesting for me.\nPeirce defines semiosis as the action of signs; which can be thought of as the dynamic correlation between objects, signs and interpretants. In this case objects are a form of presentation, signs are a form of re-presentation, and interpretants are the inferential communicative meanings.\nPeirce articulates a form of ternary logic based on categories are called 1stness, 2ndness and 3rdness. To my reasoning equate to schemas like Gurdjieffs active, passive, reconciling or Bennetts function, being, will or Landrys immanant, omniscient, transcendental. These are essentially qualities that can be found in everything, though Peirce starts from his own entry point and attributes his own specific meanings to these descriptions.\nCategories\nThe first category, 1stness, is analogous to Bennetts function; an essentially pure quality that exists without relationship and is separate from any object. The Greeks probably would have called this an ‘accident’, or a ‘property’ of something with the possibility of embodiment like colours of feelings. Monism.\n2ndness then appears to be a form of dyadic being in relation to another; subject and object, cause and effect, action and reaction, dependence and independence, here and now, force and resistance, essential and existential, first and last, nihilism and eternalism, nominalism and positivism, etc. Relation here seems to be defined largely through opposition.\n3rdness then appears to be a continuum between things, mediation and regulation of patterns which enable us to gain information and learn about the state of affairs. Bennett would probably attribute dynamism and reconciliation as properties belonging to this category, as would seem proper, and this seems implicit in Peirce.\nCorrelates\nBased on these three categories Peirce establishes three classes; presentation, representation and interpretation:\n\nThe first class is the sign itself, regardless of what the object is represents or the effect it produces. What can be said about the sign or object directly? What’s it’s tone, token or type?\nThe second class is about how the sign represents an object regardless of effect. How does the sign stand for or denote a related object? Is it an icon, index or symbol?\nThe third class describes the communicative effects such as emotions, actions or thoughts. How does the sign represent its object to the interpreter? Is it a term, proposition or argument?\n\nNine Genuine Types of Sign\nCrossing correlates and categories and we get the ‘nine genuine types of sign’\nCorrelate 1 (+)Correlate 2 (-)Correlate 3 (=)\n1stness (+)QualisignIconRhema\n2ndness (-)SinsignIndexDecisign\n3rdness (=)LegisignSymbolArgument\n\nAt this point the terms within each column needs a little explaining so let’s dig in.\nQualisign refers to a qualitative sign that is as pure as pure potential can be, meaning that it’s a completely abstract tone. Found for instance as a pure colour or timbre.\nSinsign refers to an impulse that exists and imposes into the world here and now seperated from reason - this is otherwise referred to as a token. For example the sound of thunder or a note.\nLegisign then refers to a type of law, rule or convention that is general or universal in nature. Examples that come to mind are chord constructions like major sevenths, which then regulate and determine the particular notes, or alternativly a mathmatical formula that governs a set of variables.\nIcons are signs based on similarities or resemblances, in other words they are forms of mimicry that in a pure form would have no marked differences. One can take art as an example, where an illustration would represent the life model.\nIndexes then are signs based on material or causal connections, the key words being matces or fit; for instance finger prints represent the lines on your hand. You could also say that measurements like weight or tempreture are indexes too.\nSymbols then are signs where the relation to an object is based on habbitual conventions, an example of which might be the emergency exit where icons are used to explain an idea in reference to a physical index (the door below it). These have been called idons in other languages and domains.\nRhema is an ephemearal qualitity with the possibility of interpretation such as a sensation or feeling. As it’s of a subjective nature that can neither be affirmed or denied, rhema conveys no factual information. Logically rhema can be concieved of as a proposition without a subject; “___ is a state”.\nA dicisign as the concrete instance then claims factual information about the world. It can be considered the result of an inductive proposition, where a hypothesis is tested through experiment. For example “42 is the meaning of life, existence and everything” represents a claim which upon interpretation can be affirmed or denied.\nAn argument then poses a conclusion to the union of many propositions as a necessary answer which produces an ordered and lawful effect. Such sequenced propositions guide us toward a conclusion with purpose. Formal logic like syllogism, guiding principles or meta structures can be considered arguments.\nTen Genuine Signs\nAt this point it’s very tempting to draw an enneagram with the above categories and correlates, which would probably be structured 1-9 around the edges of a circle in the order of writing; and most likely the inner hexagram would reveal some interesting information about the linkages (such an assertion boarders on dicisign).\nHowever, Peirce did something else that was quite interesting, he derrived ten triadic configurations by combining categories and correlates based on as simple rule of allowing movements of only sideways or up; these, he called the ‘ten genuine signs’. If your serious about this material, and my description of this method doesn’t make sense to you, you can reverse engineer the process by comaring the triads and formalisms with the nine types above while looking for patterns.\nFormalismTriad of termsDescription\n111Qualisign, Icon, RhemaA sign of possibility is precieved to be, similar to a possible object, producing a possible emotional effect\n211Sinsign, Icon, RhemaAn individual sign is considered to be, connected to an existent object, producing a possible emotional effect\n221Sinsign, Index, RhemaAn individual sign is considered to be, similar to an existent object, producing a possible emotional effect\n222Sinsign, Index, DeicsignAn individual sign is considered to be, similar to an existent object, producing an actual energetic effect\n311Legisign, Icon, RhemaA habitual sign represents, the qualities of its object, producing a possible emotional effect\n321Legisign, Index, RhemaA habitual sign represents, by being existentially connected to it, producing a possible emotional effect\n322Legisign, Index, DecisignA habitual sign represents, by being existentially connected to it, producing an actual energetic effect\n331Legisign, Symbol, RhemaA habitual sign represents, its object by a habbit producing, a possible emotional interpretation\n332Legisign, Symbol, DicisignA habitual sign represents, its object by a habbit producing, an actual energetic interpretation\n333Legisign, Symbol, ArgumentA habitual sign represents, its object by a habbit producing, a general logical interpretation\n\nThat’s the baisics of the theory in a nutshell, though Peirce talked of many other interesting things that are worth learning about of which I’ve barely scratched the surface of myself. For example, he considered Philosophy to be constructed from phenomenology, normative science and metaphysics. Double clicking on normative science, he considered this to be constructed of ethics (action), aesthetics (feeling) and logic (thought).\nIf your into qualitive systems thinking and cognitive semantics, Peirce is a pretty interesting writer to steep in for a while. Although he argues that terniary logic is both necessary and sufficient for proper reasoning as everything higher order systems are made of binar or ternary pairings, he still takes his investigations to further depths by varying combinations (e.g. his 6 universal predicments) and tracing paths (10 genuine signs).\nIn my view he could go further unfolding the qualitive significance of number but unearthed and articulated some important foundations none the less, and for that we owe him a debt of grattitude. Great stuff.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/books/","title":"Book Reviews","description":null,"body":"Some book reviews\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/books/trueperception/","title":"True Perception","description":null,"body":"True Perception was a book I was given for Christmas about Dharma art. Given the name you’d be forgiven for thinking its a book about art, though in many ways it is, more appropriately it’s about the art of right living - with art as the vehicle.\nTrungpas is an eloquent writer and his content is easy to read; this is in part probably due to his clear semantic framing, though he rarely settles for stable definitions instead offering multiple perspectives on the same thought object.\nAn example of this is the definition of “Dharma Art” itself which he describes in three different ways within the first chapter alone:\n\nnon-aggression and total confidence,\nunselfconsciousness and directness,\nvision and operation.\n\nHere he makes it clear that art is not supposed to be exhibitionism, which is clumsy and aggressive, instead he asserts that it should be the production of beauty - though not at the expense of others. He draws a distinction between Dharma Art and elegance, and that work for others brings delight while work on the self brings elegance. This brings out what is honest, real and earthy.\nFrom here we move into a discussion on vision; differentiating between “Great Eastern Sun” and “Setting Sun” - which are defined from a number of perspectives.\nGreat Eastern Sun is:\n\nFearless (Power, energy, strength)\nWakeful (No doubt, hesitation or regret)\nBrilliant (all pervasive goodness)\n\nThis vision is also described as having a sense of dignified confidence that is peaceful and non-aggression. Trungpa says that Great Eastern sun is a fearless victory over the three worlds of man, heaven and earth - though peaceful and shows the path, so we must develop ourselves first before we can properly engage.\nDue to this development, there forms a goodness in the self which projects decency and creates trust with an audience due to the purpose of affirming an enlightened society. This wakefulness consists of luminosity, energy and brilliance - without doubts, hesitations or regrets.\nSetting Sun on the other hand is described as a lack of bravery and complete cowardice, a constant fear that’s deliberately suicidal and wants to go to sleep; this is egoistic passion, ignorance and aggression.\nThis brings us on to the notion of “Basic Goodness” which is foundation of man heaven and earth. Man in particular should be generous and brave (dyad), wakeful, open minded and enlightened (triad) - which is the first set of Bhuddist iconographies.\nIt would seem that this gives rise to harmony which is described as plentiful, rich and minimal. Or alternatively as luscious, rich, open and spacious; “like a Jewish mother in a Japanese home” - which is in itself a pretty fearless caricature.\nTo reach such basic goodness Trungpa asserts that a meditation practice is needed; preferably in the Shamatha Vipashyana tradition, which means ‘mindful’ and ‘aware’. The realisation being that Form and Dharma are non existent and therefore cant mix, similarly there is a fuzzy boundary between openness and action. In this way art is an awareness practice that opens perspective to create focus, as opposed to a mindfulness excersize. This “Art in Everyday Life” is non possessive and non aggressive.\nBy the time we get to the chapter on “Ordinary Truth” we are at a point where we are prepared for the discussion of theistic symbolism and non theistic symbolism… or as Trungpa puts it “cosmic trips” and “everything has a place”… yes, it seems that’s indeed a shot in the foot for this blog. Oh dear.\nRegardless, this is elaborated on in the chapter “Empty Gap of Mind” as Absolute symbolism (no reference point) and Relative symbolism (symbolic references). The former is passionless, egoless and has no discursive thought. The latter he claims is based on passion, demandingness, restlessness and aggression.\nAbsolute symbolism, Trungpa claims, has a nature like the sky or space, in that it’s unborn and unceasing, though it lives in the hearts of all sentient beings. It cannot happen if there’s no place to birth it, hence a nature like space - or eternity.\nFrom this place we start to “colour our world” which is essentially letting go of the ego, or little “I” of aggression, passion and ignorance (setting sun). Ignorance being a state of basic panic, pain and bewilderment that stem from an allergy towards ourselves.\nHaving discarded these maladies, we begin to develop new sight and see things clearly, properly and directly. But what does “the process of perception” represent? That seems tricky…\n\n“The question of reality is confusing. Nobody knows. But everybody knows that somebody knows…”\n\nIf nobody knows but there is an answer out there somewhere, we have to rely on ourselves and learn to develop our own capacity to interpret ideas, suggestions and information. Reality is both comforting and confusing for these reasons as the real world is full of anxiety, pain and chaos. Trungpas remedy is a sitting practice to make friends with ourselves. He suggests that from such a place of non-aggression we can begin to see things without making demands and trying to buy or sell to others.\nIn this chapter, it would be wise to take Trungpas advice of thinking for ourselves onboard when he offers a description on how our perceptive process unfolds.\nFirstly he suggests that we see an object, secondly we mentally smell it as some kind of commentator comes along in the back of our head, then we hear the object from all around, before finally forming a relationship with it through touch and making some kind of judgement or decision. Indeed this seems based on the four term system of the “Karmas”, and such systems are representative of actions and decisions, rather than a full blown process of perception - which would likely take the form of a seven fold system.\nWith that caveat noted, Trungpas position that Dharma Art’s not really concerned with this “process”, at the end of the chapter, actually makes a lot more sense. This he suggests is like a frog sitting in the rain as a puddle forms around it with what amounts to essential indifference. However this doesn’t explain the process of perception as promised by the chapter title, though the next chapter “Being and Projecting” moves us towards such an understanding.\nThis begins with a description of the 12 Ayatanas, which are a symbolic reference to the sense perceptions and sense objects. The perceptions are thinking, seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, tasting, while the correspondent objects are mind, eye, ear, body, nose and tongue.\nIf we start with this position of “Frog in the Rain” or a sense of essential indifference, Trungpa suggests that we begin to project ourselves outwards in order to prove our existence, which then leads to a dance with the projection as it begins to unfold.\nReading between the lines here, we can determine that there are the six sense perceptions through which the dynamics of projector and projected interact. When placed together, this seems to form the outline of an enneagram; a triad within a broken hexad. Perhaps this implicitly gives rise to the “process of perception” promised by the chapter title? From the fragmets at the end of the page it would seem so.\nThe next chapter on “Lost Horizons” seems in many ways contradictory to Trungpas earlier statements - though the information still seems relevant; he starts by discussing relative symbolism and says “this does not refer to some superspiritual-materalistic vision based on altered neurological perceptions. It simply means an experience that transcends the common phenomena of good and bad, promises and threats” - which is effectively a 180º turn from the earlier affirmation that it was a “Cosmic Trip”.\nThis updated view suggests that it’s a form of visual perception developed through meditation and “without such taming of the mind, we either misjudge situations or are overpowered by them. We are unable to percieve things as they are in the fullest sense”. This feels like a more tempered perspective, given Trungpas own cognitive semantics are a form of relative symbolism. At the same time we can also note a change of attitude from being (‘frog in the rain’, ‘sitting bull’) to doing, such as jumping into “brilliant high energy pools” - though this is still distinguished from beautiful, fantastic and colourful.\n\nThe Tibeten Book of the Dead also says that if you go along with the bright and penetrating visions, you might be saved; whereas if you are facinated by the beautiful, fantastic, colorful visions, you might be trapped in the samsaric rebirth cycle again and again.\n\nIts worth paying close attention to the semantics of the words used at this point as for a laymen like myself the terms can be easily conflated. It seems the words bright and penetrating are likely used in reference to the five wisdoms; mirror like awareness, discernment, sameness, knowlege of the phenomenological dimension and acomplishment. Rather than what Trungpa would probably call a ‘Cosmic Trip’ (as beautifully illustrated by this very site ;).\nWhatever the case this chapter is a radical call out about substituting the real for the imaginary, and never quite catching the fish in the net. What Trungpa calls the lost horizon, which sends a few shocks.\nThe remedy to this he suggests is “Giving”, though this is not what you might think it means. The chapter starts by noting that the desire to learn more and more is questionable as a form of agression is taking place and how such posessive demands makes us deaf, dumb and blind - a veil preventing absolute symbolism.\nInsted Trungpa recomends giving up, opening up and surrender as a means of ridding ourselves of agression. Paradoxically, this may actually mean giving into agression in order to let it go because you couldn’t care less. It consequentially seems the point is giving in all senses, exhaling everything to the point that scales fall from your eyes and your (true) perception becomes clear, direct and precice.\n\n“Once we stop rejecting the world, it begins to pounce on us. Symbolism is imposed on us”\n\nNow, we get into the realm of “self existing humour”, which as a first principal is otherwise cosmic and breaks down the distinction between you and I. The ground from which it arises is a sense of all pervasive space or ground thats not messed up, paired with an appreciation of the play of phenomenona - perhaps otherwsise termed “Lila”.\nFor me this resonates, as I’ve been many characters in the course of my journey and am starting to see them back. By no means do I have mirror like awareness, but at times I find myself getting frustrated at charaters I’ve been before - which when noticed on reflection is actually quite a hillarious CirKus or cosmic ecology!\nThis really is an odd teapot of energetics, totally nuts, but bringing it back to Trungpa he suggests that peaceful energy is harmless, benevolent and pacifying - arising from warmth and encouragement. While wrathful energy is mocking and exposing. Sometimes our caricuture is savage and deadly, other times dignified and powerful. It’s not a lonely trip either, somebody else has been through it before and in many ways it’s all an act - yet an entirely real one!\nFrom here we move into a chapter called “Outrageousness” which seems to be the existential pole related to the essence of “non-agression”. Trungpa defines outrageousness as a direct conviction with a feeling of intense humour, energy and power penetrating inside - which makes a good deal of sense from the cosmic perspective of mirror like wisdom. There are a couple of traps here of course in relation to self-centredness, aggression and self-consciousness; in particular the presentation of the art or truth one has discovered (or is discovering).\n\n“The basic point is that there is a sense of continuity in your understanding of life. If you know who you are, what you are, where you are, and have something to say about that, you could share it with your fellow human beings. That’s fine. There’s nothing wrong with that, as long as you don’t want to publicize it. And even if you do want to publicize your embryonic discoveries, you don’t spell out the whole thing at once. It’s very tempting to spell everything out, which proves one’s legitimacy, one’s wisdom, or one’s artistry.”\n\nOutrageousness instead seems to be a sense of fearless celebration, which leads smoothly into the chapter on being a “Wise Fool”, who is open and inquisitive without frivolity or aggression; in other words a connection with reality and the phenomenal world that’s proper, gentle and generous.\nIn learning to interact with the world essentially, the discussion moves on to the “Five Styles of Creative Expression”. In many ways however, it may be better to interpret this core iconography as four styles with a neutral middle - which represents the all encompassing spaciousness and basic ground of the Bhudda (symbolised by the colour blue). We then have four other semantic coordinates.\n\n\nVajra, representing water with its clear and precise reflections. Its crisp like winter with colours of blue, white and gold. Its austere, cold and desolate, aliminium and metalic. It is the dawn rising in the east.\n\n\nRatna, representing earth with equinamity thats expansive and extending. It has a crisp Autumnal yellow to it. A rich and powerful sense of giving that’s dignified, opulent and regal, as well as a fertile, restless, earthyness thats solid and definite. It has a southern orientation.\n\n\nPadma, representing fire with a discriminating perception that sees detail. It has a spring facade to it that is red. It has no solidity or texture but is full of colour and glamour. It is concerned with output rather than input, with no concern to health or survival. It is connected with sunset and values reflection over being, art over science and practicality. It is brilliant, lucious and colourful, curvy and shapely like a lotus with a connection to wild flowers and roaming animals.\n\n\nKarma, representing wind and the automatic fulfilment of action. It’s colour is a summer green. It’s efficient, self-maintaining, active and growing with a sense of competition towards birthing something. Consequentially it has a sense of thunder and hail that can feel demonic and black, like a panther or understanding a thunder cloud.\n\n\nInverse to enlightened states, these houses also have neurotic states:\nBhudda can be spaced out rather than spacious\nVajra can be angry with intellectual fixation and ridgidity\nRatna can be fat and ostentatious, indulged to insanity\nPadma can be overly passionate, grasping, posessive with a desire to seduce the world\nKarma can be jealous, comparative and envious.\nBeyond this Trungpa distinguishes three levels of perception; experience, emptyness and luminosity. Experience just is - where “white is white” - while emptyness can be vacant or overcrowded (paradoxically leaving a lot of room, due to all the jostling life), lumonisoty then is something thats realised on the spot; which I personally interpet along the lines of creative improvisation - though it may be otherwise.\nHe says that perceptions are shifty, that they cant be reduced to words so much as their articulation takes us further from the reality - yet they are sharp, precise and tend to bring clarity. Open awareness should have a sense of connectivity, that everything is related to everything.\nIn choiceless magic he starts to speak of individuality, and with it the sense of confusion, uncertainty and chaos that arises. Here we have the choice of using the anxiety by making everything smooth, beautiful and fantastic - or turning the world into a training groundto learn more, which is suggested as preferable. This seems point at the experience of absolote symbology.\nOne key point in this chapter is in relation to the unification of everything, a group of individuals forming an organisation where everybody gets ‘turned on’ he considers a trip as such uniformity neglects individuality; in other words a consensus that “we are all playing the same game” is not considered Bhuddadharma. Same for the emulation of individuality.\nWith all this said, Trungpa does assert that there is a basic iconographic pattern to the universe, and that the intention should be to heighten individuality within the framework of some common world - which gets acknowleged as problematic at this point. Probably because of questions regarding frame.\nAt this point, my mind wanders into the teachings offered at H3uni.org and John Bennets work on General Systematics aka Qualsystems. Indeed, here is a community of individuals here holding a toolbelt of common frames; such frames are indeed a method of compressing and expressing reality into a low dimensional topology - much like bhuddist iconography.\nSuch models are useful in that they enable communication - though of course higher dimensional topologies do exist (like reality itself). “In the end, all barriers are broken through and bondages ‘annihilated’ - at that point there is room for that and this to be one”. Of course, such a perspective also has wider implications in relation to wholeness, morality, and the wider psychological enviroment of humanity.\n“One Stroke” continues along these lines with a discussion on forms of culture; pure culture derived from lineage and noncultural aesthetic expressions of meditation and devotion. This takes us into modern times and the lack of artistic lineage; since we lack a real teacher student relationship, Trungpa suggests the best path forward is to meditate a lot so that things become clearer and we develop a sense of continuity, dignity and mindfulness. Inspiration then comes from opensess and clear vision - the original Buhdda mind which is blank, nonterritorial, noncompetative and open.\nFrom this place it seems we can partake in “The Activity of Nonagression”, from which dignity emerges - a sense of gentleness and authentic-presence, which enables four actions or karmas. These seem to be synonomous with the Bhudda families above, with some expansion on the terms.\nPacifying has a sense of pure perception without sharp edges, and is related to a blue circle. Blue is related to pure sky with lots of space, and pure fresh air. Gentle and innately good, absent of neurosis and sees the world at its best.\nEnriching has a sense of richness, depicted as a yellow square with sharp corners. This relates to earth which creates boundaries for us, though also direction and has a sense of being, harmony and a well settled situation. There is also dignity, which relates to the intrinsic energy of our mind and mental state.\nMagnetising is depicted as a red half circle which is representative of emotions connected to the square earth, rounding it with reference points. This brings out passion, like an embrace or kiss, though also the meeting of minds. Richness without poverty allowing us to let go and be generous.\nKarma is depicted as a green triangle connected with activity and destruction. Green represents the strength and power of wind that is fearless. The triangle represents a dynamic balance between positive, negative and neutral - too much fearlessness becomes intellectual, too little becomes cowardice, which points to reconciling balance. Destruction relates to liberation and freedom as well, making it simple and clean cut.\nBy combining these colours we get lemon yellow and purple, imperial colours across history; the former connected with strength and the king principal, the latter with the ultimate feminine or queen principal.\nNow we arrive at a “State of Mind”, a form of wakeful magic that arises from our attitude in relation to ourselves, others and the world. Art involving a relation to ourselves and our phenomenal world gracefully. Grace implies none agression, gentleness and upliftedness - the basic attributes of cheerfulness, which enable us to beautify the world.\nWhere things go wrong is poverty - as despite talent, inteligence and vision artists have to struggle for money. Attitude and integrity become important. Trungpa suggest starting without the aim of money making, pure craft, and in working with others they begin to notice you as genuine, interesting, dedicated and brave. From such a place of gentle goodness, dedication and trueness, our work rises to another dimension - one that is uplifting visually, audibly and psychologically - visual Dharma that gives one a sense of composure that inspires richness, beauty and decorum. This can then hold the world together without causing schism.\nSeeing is distinguished from looking; first thought best thought, second thought maybe preferable. Impressions and then going beyond with a threefold logic of perception, appreciation and presentation; the ground, the path and then fruition. This logic can also be seen as the heaven, earth, human principal or the bodies of Tibetean vajrayana Bhuddism - dharmakaya, sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya. However they are described, they can be seen as background manifestation, potential manifestation and finally manifesting altogether.\nIn the Shambala tradition its “Heaven, Earth, Human”:\n\n\nHeaven is the coming down to earth with a sense of goodness, gentleness and togetherness. Looking down and conquering space with an unyeilding regality thats open and playful. The darkside is that tripping out on it could con you into situations through self-deception, so best start with first mind best mind - just a little dot on a blank page like primordial consciousness thats wakeful, delighted and briliant. From this state of mind and the right attitude and experience of space, comes what is known as blessing or sacredness. With no struggle we can relax and discover the sacred world without being smart or clever, whether mathmatically, technically or politically. This sacredness binds the heaven principle.\n\n\nEarth is then grounded and encompassing. Its first principal is the ‘absence of neurosis’ - defined as fixation or clinging that can be further articulated as passion which is too gluey or gooey, agression which is too sharp, threatening or rejecting, and ignorance, which is a state of stupour that cant discriminate black from white. As it is absent qualities the second principal suggests its ‘thorougly relaxed, soft and wholesome’. The third principal is ‘absence of lazyness’ so has a certain drive to achieve - no half-visions - as that would be breaking the morality and dicipline of artistic endevour. However as Earth is so gentle however, it may become overly domestic, or accomodating of everything - including chaos.\n\n\nHuman has two principals, the first being ‘freedom from subconscious gossip’; if our minds are full of thought it is due to a lack of relation to the heaven or earth principals. Executing work is one way to cut this. The second principal is ‘absence of regret’ be they in the past or future, looking back and forward all the time as a kind of slick but deep rooted depression that obscures heaven and earth - making us unproductive. The Human principal need not reference either heaven or earth, its just individual existence taking place, but when it does to binds heaven and earth together the universal monarch emerges. This king principal arises as a dynamic all three dharmas. Going back to “Basic Goodness” you might in other languages say this is the alchemical child; one that is both cute and daring, yet with openness and strength!\n“Endless Richness” emerges from this reconcilliation and things begin to flow. Like any craft you work with a technique for a long time and it then falls away. You just relate to the object of perception and adapt when things go wrong. An example of a participative movie is offered, which would require the interrelation of a lot of space, speed and richness. Which should make suggestions rather than feed information so they have to work and think about the presentation. Just a corner of knowlege.\nThis modality is related to teaching. Someone doing so by information alone may say wise and beautiful things, yet not know how to handle the gaps. Someone that lives the teaching however won’t fidget or blush, the teaching is engrained in their being so theres no embarassment at mistakes, things just go on and on, like waves of the ocean in endless richness. You recieve a lot, without feeling ‘dumped on’ because theres clearly much more to be said.\n\n\n“Back to square one” points at a moon that in turn points back at us with a mirror like essence. We shape our world in accord with our ideas, beliefs and dreams, which in turn haunt us and shape our being. He says that people get trapped in this creation and get trapped, seeing it as unjustified or undeserved. We then go so far as to discuss the suestion of spirituality, the ultimate level of judgement and the question of being fair to everybody. Perhaps this is the metaphor of Hungry ghosts?\nThinking before action is advised, though like everything this unfolds into questions of how to think, what to think about, why to think and so forth as you can think anything you want. He suggests that it should be directed, but not with dogma, philosophy or concepts. Instead we are “Back to Square One” - who or what thinks and whats the thinking process? It seems we must see ourselves and our thoughts to be genuinely uncoloured. Square one “is what it is”; desolate, spacious and without feedback. When we are forced to pounce, which will happen, we mess it all up - so staying with it and holding our ground seems to be the lesson, especially as theres no way to get out.\n\nWhen you have one, that indicates that you have two and three and four. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that you are going to get to square two and the rest of it. Then you have zero, which is not any kind of figure. It denotes nothing, I suppose. We want to be something, right? Even if we are back to square one, we are there, we are somethi. We dont’t wish te be nothing and we constantly try to avoid that. That is the problem. So the only alternative–not even alternative, but only choice, so to speak–is to be zero. So square one is the basic ground from which we function, and square zero seems to be beyound even our functioning. Isness, without any definitions. It is not so much branching out, but branching in. There is still resistance to going back to zero, and it has always been a problem that square one could be the excuse for you not to have to go back to zero. At least you have the number one to clench on to; at leas there’s that first number you made. You achieved your identity at square one, and that seems to be the problem. So ultimately, one has to return to zero. Then you begin to feel that you can move around. You can do a lot of things, not be numbered. You’re not subject to your own numbers, and you are not confined to a pidgeonhole. So your situation can be improved if you know that you have nothing bet vero, which is nothing. There’s no referenc point anymore, just zero. Try it. It is an expression of immense generosity and immense enlightenment.\n\nFrom zero, we can go to one - “Art Begins At Home” - Dharma art as natural awareness. Phrased another way, the Greek word “oikos” comes to mind, which is the root of economy and ecology. How we do one small thing is how we do everything - hence Dharma Art as a state of natural awareness.\nPerhaps this is the “Human” principal, which reconciles “Heaven and Earth”? Why do we label ourselves artists? Or cling to our mediums? Trungpa suggests that Dharma means “norm” or “truth” that is at peace and cool, reducing the heat of neurosis - a state before touching our brush or instrument.\n\n“For instance, you might go up in the mountains and catch a baby monkey and bring him home, hoping that little baby monkey can play on your shoulder, run around your courtyard, and play in your kitchen. You hope he will relieve your claustrophobia, the heat of your neurosis. When he first decides to come along with you, that baby monkey might behave himself. But over time he begins to become an extension of our neurosis… the same way as your artwork does”\n\nTalent then comes from the appreciation of basic beauty and basic goodness arising from the fundemental peace and coolness of dharma, at which point conflict begins to subside to clear perception. The purpose of a work of art is bodhisattva action; meaning that our production, manifestation, demonstration and performance should be geared towards waking people up from neurosis.\nFinally we are brought back to the closing statement on art and society “in Dharma art, what we are trying to do is tame our society, including ourselves”. Great Eastern Sun, Trungpa asserts, is humble and gentle with some additional qualities of precision, warmth, kindness.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/books/caravanofdreams/","title":"Caravan of Dreams","description":null,"body":"\n\n\nCaravan of Dreams is a parade of pluralistic perspectives, illiminating various facets of timeless wisdom through the tradition of Sufi story telling. What’s most remarkable is the wisdom conveyed between the lines, ambigous messaging deliberatly concealed to draw out ones interpretative abilities.\nIn such a respect, it’s said that each story is like a seed that may eventually germinate into something more substantial upon it’s realisation. This may never happen but given sufficient time and life experience a garden may bloom in the mind of the reader. My own interpretative lens suggests that much of what was never said, yet that which is seemingly recognisable, seems based upon sound foundations - especially stories such as those on foolslandia or about animals. It’s a weird old world and wisdom is one of the ways of navigating it.\nSome stories, with knowledge of Shas background, even provide some form of magical meta context, reading as though at times that Shah is inhabiting or being inhabited by a number of perspectives and writing the narrative of what seems like various school yard squabbles playing out between his inner and outer cosmos. This is itself quite illuminating and perhaps later prepares the reader for the reality they may soon be faced with?\nTo that end, some stories are a few pages and others are a few lines, the latter of which feel, to my senses, more potent - often with the elegance of a haiku.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/books/energiesmaterialvitalcosmic/","title":"Energies; material, vital, cosmic","description":null,"body":"\nHow come at points in my life I’m crackling with as much energy a tesla coil, while at other periods it feels as though I’ve a rubber soul? What determines the quality, quantity and intensity of this phenomena? Can answers be harnessed towards human flourishing at personal, local and global levels?\nWhile I have no clear answers, we might be able to draw some inferences based on John Bennetts lifetime of studies, in particular his schema of the twelve energy levels. These have also been taught at H3uni.org by Anthony Hodgson as part of the Cosmic Ecology course.\nHaving attempted to climb the mountain of John Bennetts Dramatic universe series myself, I can share from experience it’s an exceptionally dense rock of knowledge. The book “energies; material, vital, cosmic” is a set of crumbs from that ideas table, and significantly more digestible for such a reason - in other words what a bloody great book!\nEssentially the book is a set of lectures about Bennett’s twelve levels of energy and the pentadic diagrams used to articulate the eight cosmoses of reciprocal maintenance. As Gurdjieff would have put it, this schema is about learning “to do” through the “laws of world creation and maintenance” - though the material is more informative than pragmatic.\nWhat I mainly took from this book is a correction to my thinking process and some fresh inspiration for thinking about questions like “what is photosynthesis?” or “does free energy exist?”. Here Bennett’s descriptions of energetic levels and his systematic methodology for considering the relationships opens up a field of fresh insights, where in biology or the standard model of physics seems to get stuck.\nInvestigating material energies, we get some interesting relationships, and it may essentially be that Bennett outlines the keys to Teslas free energy as the crystalline cosmos. At the very least he seems to be waaay ahead of the curve detailing what appears to be extropic.ai’s hardware acceleration.\nIn this case the crystalline cosmos is composed of five energies; E12 dissipative, E11 directed, E10 cohesive, E9 tensile, E8 vital. The names are descriptive of their qualities, though can be substituted with other attributes, which help to further clarify their essence.\nSo by recycling heat, directing it, organising it, concentrating it and releasing it in a desired pattern an anabolic reaction is created. At the same time, inefficiencies in fitting the pattern and so forth creates a catabolic reaction which produces waste in the form of heat. It would seem that this can be maintained in perpetuity by a ‘sorting daemon’ which requires little if any energetic input by simply skimming the necessary energy from flows occurring between chambers, which is illustrated in the book.\nIn theory this sounds good but we still might want to test it out, although retroductivly drawing on personal experience it seems about on point regarding cycles of hyperstimulation and burn out. Coincidentally, in Bennetts schema of energies this ‘burn out’ modality may actually be the excessive weight of higher energies like conscious energy which is likened to a black flame, or the sun in Platos cave where those exposed to such energy wish to withdraw back into the comfort of darkness… Couldn’t tell you, but talk about an interesting reframe!\nSo that’s it for the book review, we can probably discuss the subject of energies in significantly more depth by using methods like systematics and qualsystems to tease out links and relationships between the modalities. The subject of another post however!\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/portfolio/","title":"Portfolio","description":null,"body":"Here are various creative projects I’ve undertaken.

This comes from our teams desire to bridge the gap between research and implementation.\nThe proposal below outlines the current state of our implementation plan and we are soliciting discussion and feedback for further advancement. There is plenty of scope for improvement, which we trust will happen as we advance our work. We believe that the proposal submitted to PL can help lay strong research foundations; while Regen is fertile soil for technical implementation that contributes to grounded impact in real communities.\nSpecifications\nRegen Registry defines Nature Based Solutions in the following manner:\n\n“Adaptive Capital” is subsequently a proposition for valuing living ecosystems through multi-perspective architecture and the free energy principal; a means of evaluating quantitive measures with qualitative outcomes. For such a project to find traction, we need to consider the existential domains of markets, science and technology; while holding in mind the essential values of people, planet and protocols. Let’s explore our assumptions about these domains:\nMarket Assumptions Markets are seeking pathways for divestment from degenerate commodities to more regenerative investment vehicles. However the divestment is constrained by a lack of said pathways and it’s estimated that there are two trillion dollars of stranded assets trading on Wall St. books. In the authors opinion this number represents a transformation opportunity thats global in scale provided we can address the markets pain points with integrity. Please see the RFP-X Research doc for a more detailed contextual framing on this subject.\nScientific Assumptions When it comes to addressing the markets with integrity, we need to incorporate truth claims and anchor this context. The methods used and the claims made are important; Popper believed science was about the raw explanatory power and predictive capacity of a framework, while Khun thought of it as a community of practice.\nIn our view both authors are correct; reason can thought of as rational proof (deductive knowledge utilising the Baconian methodology) and as empiric verification (inductive wisdom through the Goethian methodology). Consequentially the ReSci movement might consider integrating both these fundamental approaches to making truth claims by leveraging abductive reasoning and Bayesian methods. These base predictions on known priors before feeding forward to infer likely outcomes.\nTechnological Assumptions From a practical standpoint the story of digital communication begins with Claude Shannons information theory; binary 1’s and 0’s that convey state. Beyond Shannon’s fundamental theory of bits and bytes, there are new innovations that abstract his binary domain into a trinary lens of “agents, languages and perspectives” where agents, speaking their language of preference, express perspectives on ‘Truth claims’.\nAs a technical architecture, such a ‘meta ontology’ enables us to encode other frameworks as ‘perspectives’, and in particular we believe that encoding “general systematics” is a particularly powerful epistemological framework that can act as a functional backbone for articulating parameter groupings in a transparent way.\nApplied at the interface level these functional frameworks can be used to generate a consistent set of active inference models that enable the composable encoding of practice based methodologies, eco-credits, accounting methodologies, evaluation criteria, sensor networks APIs, DAOs and far beyond. Such architecture is particularly elegant as it enables semantic translation and ad hoc composibility for an apples to oranges comparison of quantitive measures to qualitative values.\nInfrastructure Design\nLet’s frame the high level design abstractions we will lean on in relation to our ends: These could more sensibly be framed as:\n\nMarkov blankets act as a form of general substrate that can then be further systematised with metadata to enable semantic interoperability - this is a highly general medium that is analogus to merkle trees and hash graphs. In Regens case this technical infrastructure is represented by the data module.\nAn Impact certificate essentially articulates a given methodology in a machine readable format. These certificates represent a set of means, while evaluation criteria codified in a similar format can express values as ends. For example - when it comes to open science - there is a growing movement towards making papers more accessible by encoding them as ‘conversation graphs’; this might be represented in a tetradic geometry with nodes representing:\n\nExtrapolating such a concept one step further it’s easy enough to imagine a form of bespoke facilitation where the content of any conversation can be functionally represented as geometries to support the processes of communal understanding.\nWhen a discussion reaches consensus on credit class, methodology, DAO design, evaluation criteria etc. we can use the interface to easily store and anchor data on chain. Any subsequent dialogue can be self-managed by the community, easily updating their credit design parameters through their governance process through a simple interface. Supporting conversation and data can be aggregated as a form of composable capital to be issued as eco-credits which would democratise access to technology in a significant way. Such a process can even be turned into art or gamified to make the process fun and rewarding!\nBelow the interface level comes the functional specifications for on chain integration. Using the AD4M ontology we can integrate general systematics to describe a set of metadata standards. From there we can describe both the data module and eco-credit modules as ‘languages’ and ‘perspectives’ in order to make them interoperable with other systems architectures. For added precision, we may wish to add other ontological ‘perspectives’ for translating quantity (data module claims like MRV) to quality (eco-credit attestations like REA).\nIn the case of the latter Resource, Event, Agent accounting is a particularly useful ontology to integrate as its institutionally recognised accounting standard for distributed supply chains. This might then use feeds from Monitoring, Reporting and Verification technologies as evaluation criteria for impact certificates. The elegance of this design is that if these standards are changed or extended, they can be easily recomposed or updated.\nFor example we can extend the triadic geometry MRV to be a tetradic geometry for a more detailed resolution. The following was articulated by dMeter community members:\n\nUltimately whatever indicators are at desirable can be articulated through General Systematics and codified as Markov blankets to unlock the capabilities of semantically composable impact markets. These functional models can then be enriched with Active Inferencing to provide a more detailed depth of resolution.\nPilot Tokenomic Mechanism(s): Adaptive Capital\nThe architecture above is designed at the level of general infrastructure and can be used for composing any desirable credit design, which is dependent on the articulation of parametric groupings instantiated around a use case or pilot project. These paramaters and the rules governing them matter significantly when scaled to the level community, commons or bioregion.\nThere are already number of great projects in the Regen ecosystem that would stand to benefit from such composable designs and we’re keen to partner based on DAO capacity. LunarPunk Labs as proposal authors have a strong preference towards working closely with our existing partners at the charity Regenerating Sonora in order to build out a low risk pilot project. Conditions around them are exceptionally vital as they have LEHR gardens, a community centre with a blockchain learning desk and high school tech club working with Arudino sensors!\nBasic Credits: Regenerating Sonora use case\n\nCommunity Capital: H3 University use case\nAn example methodology our students might use to additionally codify the co-benefits produced by the communities vibrant social capital is the H3uni framework deployed on the current course “The art of creative collaboration”. This particular practice based methodology groups eight sets of parameters under four framing conditions.\nFraming conditions:\n\nParamater Groupings:\n\nThis particular methodology is currently being demonstrated as both the H3uni course with video documentary evidence AND is being discussed amongst our teams on WeCo.io as a ‘weave’ (chains of 1min audio recordings / 140 character cards in a sequence as a conversation graph). The data from this form of ‘prosocial-computation’ can all be anchored on a storage medium of choice using the Regen Data Module.
