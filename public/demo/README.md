# Blog Design Demos

This folder contains 5 different visual design options for your blog, each showcasing a different approach to incorporating images into the article listing.

## How to View

Open each HTML file in your web browser to see the design in action. Each demo is a standalone HTML page with embedded CSS showing how the layout would look.

## Design Options

### 1. Hero Image Cards (`1-hero-image-cards.html`)
**Magazine Style**
- Large featured images (300px height) at the top of each card
- Title overlaid on image with gradient for readability
- Best for: Editorial content, blogs with high-quality hero images

### 2. Thumbnail + Content (`2-thumbnail-content.html`)
**Medium/Dev.to Style**
- Compact horizontal layout with thumbnail on left (200x150px)
- More articles visible per page (space-efficient)
- Best for: Content-focused blogs, technical writing, frequent updates

### 3. Grid with Cover Images (`3-grid-cover-images.html`)
**Pinterest/Unsplash Style**
- Full-bleed cover images filling entire cards
- Text overlaid at bottom with dark gradient
- Responsive grid layout
- Best for: Visual blogs, photography, design portfolios, travel writing

### 4. Enhanced Blurred Background (`4-enhanced-blurred-background.html`)
**Current Design Enhanced**
- Maintains your existing card structure
- Large blurred background images for visual interest
- Glass-morphism effect for elegant look
- Most similar to your current Duckquill theme
- Best for: Elegant enhancement while maintaining readability

### 5. Split Layout (`5-split-layout.html`)
**Alternating Editorial Style**
- 50/50 split between image and content
- Cards alternate image position (left/right)
- More breathing room and whitespace
- Best for: Long-form content, feature articles, editorial blogs

## Implementation Notes

- All demos use CSS gradients as placeholder images
- Your Duckquill theme already supports banner images via `page.extra.banner`
- Demo #4 (Enhanced Blurred Background) requires the least changes to implement
- All layouts are responsive and work on mobile devices

## Next Steps

1. Choose your preferred design
2. Decide if you want to use actual images or keep gradient placeholders
3. I can help implement the chosen design into your Zola templates and SASS files
