&lt;p&gt;Having played with the VSM for some time and swam around the Metaphorum space a little I believe the model to be pretty useful, but perceive a massive UX issue.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, many people at Metaphorum were hitting a bootstrapping issue where they had to sell the client on the model to get the investment to teach (indoctrinate) them about the model, rather than simply realising the models ‘emancipatory’ power.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing particularly wrong with the model, but the approach that’s being taken is of Horizon one learning; in other words indoctrination through presentation. While at Metaphorum in 2023 and 2024 it became apparent to me that these models are essentially toy’s to be played with, and if they are to be emancipatory they should probably be less about the information and more about the shared practice…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;development-history&quot;&gt;Development History&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a visit to Metaphorum in Manchester 2023 - organised in part by Ian Kendrick - I found the that the VSM was much easier to make sense of and remember when represented through the lens of a pentad. At one point or other Anthony Hodgson offered five node labels which were useful attractors for retaining information while visiting, and it also felt more in line with Staffords later work which was more geometrical in representation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was how I learnt the core concepts in 2023, but I found the ‘nodal buckets’ approach a bit prone over flow; which is notably the approach taken by the VSM canvas. What happens is that you end up a bit overwhelmed with a lot of content that sits in a heap lacking context.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2024 I was trying to better grasp the links of the pentad, which are given in QS terms, but without a second instance to compare against I was struggling to come to grips with them. Around this point Ian Kendrick shared document with a ‘viability assessment’ by Anthony Hodgson… Gold!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The representation was not the standard VSM diagram, nor a pentad, but some bricky flowers somewhere between. Regardless, it had the connectives I needed for my research so I noted them down for safe keeping. Around this time there was also a lot of stuff happening with the Pioneers, but none of it seemed particularly contextualised; in other words it felt like there was a lot of action that made little sense to an outside observer, even those like me attending weekly meetings.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point there was a hexagon dump so I took all the material and filtered it through the pentadic VSM representation as a diagnostic and things became a lot clearer. While this was useful in isolation, I believe that the representation is probably a pedagogical tool that solves many of the issues mentioned above. In other words for the VSM to be emancipatory, it needs to be participitory and accessible, which the pentadic representation solves for.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an image of some prototyping:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;vsm-prototype.png&quot; alt=&quot;VSM Prototype with Hexagons&quot; class=&quot;no-hover&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;method&quot;&gt;Method&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-1&quot;&gt;Step 1&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the relevant canvas on a board.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-2&quot;&gt;Step 2&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discuss either:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the labelled nodes and edges and record articulations that come up on hexagons&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;matters of concern and record articulations that come up on hexagons&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-3&quot;&gt;Step 3&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place hexagons in relevant positions on the canvas.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-4&quot;&gt;Step 4&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflect on wholeness, rearrange as necessary and use for further diagnostics and tracking agendas, tasks, initiatives etc. Get a little creative and think of possibilities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;canvas&quot;&gt;Canvas&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;generic-vsm-pentad&quot;&gt;Generic VSM Pentad&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These representations were shared on a whiteboard and discussed with members of the Metaphorum community in 2024. Most responded positively, especially Martin Pfieffer, who offered some help ensuring representational integrity based on his knowledge of the VSM.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further variations and refinements could still be made, should others take an interest in offering their own interpretations. The goal however is less to question the semantics (as much is drawn from Tonys work) but to move away from Horizon one presentations, towards Horizon three learning through praxis and play.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost/blog/monastic-design/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;context&quot;&gt;Context&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mondays QS Study Group, participants experimented with QualSystems as a dialogic design tool for about 30m. As an experimental instance of applying QS methods to visual facilitation, it seemed relevant to document some of the learnings and share them here.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study group gathered to discuss the structure of the octad and an outline of the session intent was shared in the form of an enneagram so wonky that would probably make Gurdjieff weep. Here is the slide for reference:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;outline.png&quot; alt=&quot;Session Outline Enneagram&quot; class=&quot;no-hover&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group then read the material from Tony’s QS book and skimmed some examples as an overview. Phil (@ptatenz) then took us through an analysis of an advanced example which Night Hawk (@anthony.hodgson) had previously shared on public transport, this then led to further discussion about the theory, particularly nodes within the arena. As discussion drew to a close on this, we drew our attention towards practice with a very loosely framed workshop on a coordination task with plenty of shared context.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;task&quot;&gt;Task&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essential task was simply to coordinate some form of applied group study as praxis learning. However to accomplish this exercise, an existential task was necessary; in this case designing the H3uni resource library.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;method&quot;&gt;Method&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dialogue about a shared frame and topic of reference, visually facilitated with a very light touch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;process&quot;&gt;Process&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were instructed to contemplate the core grammar or terms of the octad, before reformulating them as questions in relation to the existential task. These were then to be offered to each other, with answers documented on sticky notes. In retrospect, the form reminds me of monastic debate; so perhaps the process, or at least this first step, can be called “monastic design”?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;Result&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;design-canvas.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Design Canvas Output&quot; class=&quot;no-hover&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;learnings&quot;&gt;Learnings&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conditions here were exceedingly favourable for something to emerge and the session could have gone south pretty easily in other contexts; participants knew each other, meet regularly, are familiar with the base methodologies and subject matter, meaning that both frame and task had been discussed for a considerable length of time (formally and informally).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the outer terms and re-framing them as questions seemed agreeable and generative within the context of this group, allowing participants to propose interpretations and co-create the frame of inquiry, which had a causal texture that felt somewhat ‘Ratna’ to my own senses:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positives&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; include lively and innovative discussion with little disagreement requiring very little intervention.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negatives&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; include a sense of unresolved scope creep towards the end of the workshop, that in a larger group would become untenable - though not particularly uncomfortable in this instance.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambiguous&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; elements include the process of reformulating the core grammar into questions as a method that somewhat emerged from the context of the study group. The lack of definition contributed to scope creep, but also generated a lot of meaning making within the group about the deep structure. There’s a sense that we got lucky as the approach seems to align well with step one of the core collaborative process, though seems unlikely to work out in the long run as a set it and forget it strategy.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indeterminate&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; elements are perhaps things the lack of evaluation criteria to judge success or failure by. At the essential level we discussed the octad in a practical way and began to use it in practice around a specific task - which is a desirable result, while on the other hand the resource library is a rather large project with a long and slow feed back loop making existential results indeterminate.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would practitioners be interested in discussing the build out of a ‘this’ still very open method? It would be great to get feedback from experiment participants about their sense of the causal, as well as how to ‘dance hammer’ this octad into something similar yet different to and from other methodologies like the Wheel of Wisdom.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My core learning here is that if methodologies are developed from the generic octad, they are probably then ‘coloured’ by the specific task or activity - such as the resource library in this case, which in turn when stated out loud reminds me of the heptad of design (light, colour, lines, form, texture, pattern, space). Having wondered how various courses and methodologies form, I’m starting to wonder if our little study group lucked into the first step?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
