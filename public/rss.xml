          <description xml:base="https://joshafairhead.com/portfolio/systematicsapi/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joshafairhead.com&#x2F;portfolio&#x2F;systematicsapi&#x2F;HeptadEngineeringTemplate.png#no-hover&quot; alt=&quot;Engineering&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Joshfairhead&#x2F;SystematicsAPI-v0.0.2&quot;&gt;Here is the v0.0.2 codebase&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The systematics API started as a way to store, preserve, search and retrieve the work of Tony Hodgson and JG Bennett - as well as other traditions that make use of such semantic structures. In short these systems are ways of organising information into knowledge ecologies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its probably best to look at this initiative in horizons; so this basic funcitionality can be considered horizon one. The potential use cases of these structures in horizon two or three would seem to go much further than storage and preservation, but for now I’d like to keep things scoped to generic functionality rather than more visionay aspects of the work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;initial-thinking-and-learnings&quot;&gt;Initial thinking and Learnings&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of creating this API I basically articulated the various systems and tried implementing them in various ways. The simplist was through the Rust type system; enumerating the various systems and their values and then bundling this all up in a hash table. I then added an interface, which created the issue of state management so I rebuilt the state model but not the interface. The issue with this implementation is that it’s not very composable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indexs, coordinates, terms, were needed to create the graphs, which were then constructed with a builder pattern. Doing this in state the ‘naieve way’ meant that I needed to articulate every permutation of index, coord, term and all the combinations of combinations (for links) to get the composability I wanted. While possible, this was not extensible because adding another object would requrie updating the state machine with exponential permutations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is basically where v0.0.2 lies; rigidly defined structures. I basically got it to a place where it worked and then decided to refactor. Following the white rabbit led me to category theory and some pretty advanced maths I’d never encountered.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current v0.0.3 attempts implementation by articulating base ‘elements’ such as index, coord, term as entries and then use link moprhisms to compose the systems. This is in the right direction, but is still not producting the desired results. Basically we have different link types that are transitive and&#x2F;or commute using the category theory criterea of Identity, Association and Composition. Connect an index, coordinate and&#x2F;or term with an ‘identity’ link to create a higher order entity - this creates a groupoid through transitivy (meaning that if I connect index and coord, where term is connected to coord, then term and index automatically connect). Then connect any of these base elements in groupoid A, to another with an ‘association’ link in groupoid B and all the elements should link automaticall through asymetric transitivity - meaning that connecting index in groupoid A to any element in groupoid B such as a coordinate or term maps all index, coord, terms across groupoids A and B.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This actually works as a proof of concept but it’s a blunt approach that requires deeper research. Namely that there are higher order structures than just terms and connectives like designations and coherence attributes. As far as base connectivity goes this is fine within a system, but what about composing across systems such as dyads &amp;gt; triads? or comparing systems of the same type but with different semantics?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A field of action starts emerging here; objects and categories, morphisms and functors. However when it comes to code, it seems to imply that category theory needs to be implemented before I can construct systems correctly and even then things are quite messy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance; if we compare a triad by Bennet and a triad by Landry we are comparing isomoprhic structures, with isomorphic nodes (though nodes within the structures are probably internally polymorphic). Now, the question about this is if such a morphism is also a functor? From the perspective of triad to triad, the mapping is isomorphic because its within the category of ‘triad’. However we are also mapping across the categorical instances of ‘Bennett’ and ‘Landry’, which would make it a functor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not being a mathmatician or computer scientist I’m out of my depth to say how such people think about these problems, but it seems they have encountered a thing called ‘Russels Paradox’ which is a set of all sets issue. The uncertainty of which they seem to resolve by creating a hierarchy of universes. This set off a lightbulb because for some reason the Benned duodecad is presented as a hierarchy of 12 levels, so I gave that a go to little success. The issue here becomes both the rigid hierarchy and the infinite horizonal categories… the rock and the whirlpool.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rock represents the need for categorical hierarchy (the category of categories), yet the whirlpool resists because we have infinite possible horizontal categories where there is no hierarchy - such as index and coordinates (the categories of topolagy vs geometry). In computer science this dyad is stack and heap.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the question is how the hell to do this on a computing infrastructure built on binary logic?? Well from an earlier (unmentioned) excrusion of equating mathmatical operations to systems I discovered operation types such as ‘union’, ‘intersect’, ‘product’, ‘superset’ and so fourth - which all have a qualitive flavour. Having tried and failed to implement these, while getting utterly lost in recursion, I discovered another term in category theory called DSU or “Disjoint Set, Union”. Is this the monad of monads or even a nullad I wonder? Maybe. Then it dawns on me that Holochain as a distributed hash table with content addressable storage is essentially a DSU, which has generic types of ‘entries’ and ‘links’ as its fundemental dyad.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m basically still in research mode, but assuming that I can use entries to represent types of objects and categroies and links to represent morphisms and functors (it actully looks like the system may be built on category theory), I still need to work out the relativity of the various ‘elements’. In other words theres specific units needed in order to describe a system (index, coordinate, term = node) and there are critical functions that are not directly needed as part of the system, but give it critical funcitonality - such as the morphism or functor types.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, looking back to the heptad of engineering template, I wonder if this the research portion nearing completion? Is the next step imagination and&#x2F;or prototype? How does this relate to the octad? Have I mapped out the units as systems? critical functions as objects, categories, morphisms and functiors? The platform as Holochain? And am now working on resources? It seems so though it was pretty unintentional - even resisted.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description xml:base="https://joshafairhead.com/portfolio/adaptivecapital/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commonwealth.im&#x2F;regen&#x2F;discussion&#x2F;10002-rfp-tokenomics-20-proposal-adaptive-capital&quot;&gt;Adaptive Capial Proposal&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tokenomics Proposal: “Adaptive Capital“&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are essentially proposing an ecosystem level partnership between Regen Network and Protocol Labs through the mutual funding of a Tokenomics DAO. This comes from our teams desire to bridge the gap between research and implementation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal below outlines the current state of our implementation plan and we are soliciting discussion and feedback for further advancement. There is plenty of scope for improvement, which we trust will happen as we advance our work. We believe that the proposal submitted to PL can help lay strong research foundations; while Regen is fertile soil for technical implementation that contributes to grounded impact in real communities.
Specifications&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regen Registry defines Nature Based Solutions in the following manner:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;Actions to protect, regeneratively manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits”.
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Adaptive Capital” is subsequently a proposition for valuing living ecosystems through multi-perspective architecture and the free energy principal; a means of evaluating quantitive measures with qualitative outcomes. For such a project to find traction, we need to consider the existential domains of markets, science and technology; while holding in mind the essential values of people, planet and protocols. Let’s explore our assumptions about these domains:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market Assumptions Markets are seeking pathways for divestment from degenerate commodities to more regenerative investment vehicles. However the divestment is constrained by a lack of said pathways and it’s estimated that there are two trillion dollars of stranded assets trading on Wall St. books. In the authors opinion this number represents a transformation opportunity thats global in scale provided we can address the markets pain points with integrity. Please see the RFP-X Research doc for a more detailed contextual framing on this subject.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific Assumptions When it comes to addressing the markets with integrity, we need to incorporate truth claims and anchor this context. The methods used and the claims made are important; Popper believed science was about the raw explanatory power and predictive capacity of a framework, while Khun thought of it as a community of practice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our view both authors are correct; reason can thought of as rational proof (deductive knowledge utilising the Baconian methodology) and as empiric verification (inductive wisdom through the Goethian methodology). Consequentially the ReSci movement might consider integrating both these fundamental approaches to making truth claims by leveraging abductive reasoning and Bayesian methods. These base predictions on known priors before feeding forward to infer likely outcomes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technological Assumptions From a practical standpoint the story of digital communication begins with Claude Shannons information theory; binary 1’s and 0’s that convey state. Beyond Shannon’s fundamental theory of bits and bytes, there are new innovations that abstract his binary domain into a trinary lens of “agents, languages and perspectives” where agents, speaking their language of preference, express perspectives on ‘Truth claims’.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a technical architecture, such a ‘meta ontology’ enables us to encode other frameworks as ‘perspectives’, and in particular we believe that encoding “general systematics” is a particularly powerful epistemological framework that can act as a functional backbone for articulating parameter groupings in a transparent way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applied at the interface level these functional frameworks can be used to generate a consistent set of active inference models that enable the composable encoding of practice based methodologies, eco-credits, accounting methodologies, evaluation criteria, sensor networks APIs, DAOs and far beyond. Such architecture is particularly elegant as it enables semantic translation and ad hoc composibility for an apples to oranges comparison of quantitive measures to qualitative values.
Infrastructure Design&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s frame the high level design abstractions we will lean on in relation to our ends: These could more sensibly be framed as:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;(+) Qualitative values 
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;(=) Systematised Markov blankets
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;(-) Quantitive measures
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markov blankets act as a form of general substrate that can then be further systematised with metadata to enable semantic interoperability - this is a highly general medium that is analogus to merkle trees and hash graphs. In Regens case this technical infrastructure is represented by the data module.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Impact certificate essentially articulates a given methodology in a machine readable format. These certificates represent a set of means, while evaluation criteria codified in a similar format can express values as ends. For example - when it comes to open science - there is a growing movement towards making papers more accessible by encoding them as ‘conversation graphs’; this might be represented in a tetradic geometry with nodes representing:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;Directive: Source 
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;Instrumental: Question
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;Ground: Claim
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;Ideal: Proof
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extrapolating such a concept one step further it’s easy enough to imagine a form of bespoke facilitation where the content of any conversation can be functionally represented as geometries to support the processes of communal understanding.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a discussion reaches consensus on credit class, methodology, DAO design, evaluation criteria etc. we can use the interface to easily store and anchor data on chain. Any subsequent dialogue can be self-managed by the community, easily updating their credit design parameters through their governance process through a simple interface. Supporting conversation and data can be aggregated as a form of composable capital to be issued as eco-credits which would democratise access to technology in a significant way. Such a process can even be turned into art or gamified to make the process fun and rewarding!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below the interface level comes the functional specifications for on chain integration. Using the AD4M ontology we can integrate general systematics to describe a set of metadata standards. From there we can describe both the data module and eco-credit modules as ‘languages’ and ‘perspectives’ in order to make them interoperable with other systems architectures. For added precision, we may wish to add other ontological ‘perspectives’ for translating quantity (data module claims like MRV) to quality (eco-credit attestations like REA).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the latter Resource, Event, Agent accounting is a particularly useful ontology to integrate as its institutionally recognised accounting standard for distributed supply chains. This might then use feeds from Monitoring, Reporting and Verification technologies as evaluation criteria for impact certificates. The elegance of this design is that if these standards are changed or extended, they can be easily recomposed or updated.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example we can extend the triadic geometry MRV to be a tetradic geometry for a more detailed resolution. The following was articulated by dMeter community members:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;Directive: Human-sensing (Personal data stores, phone images, self reported data)
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;Instrumental: Remote-sensing (IOT sensors, devices)
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;Ideal: Sky-sensing (satellite, drones, aerial)
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;Ground: Reputation-sensing (identity, community, trust)
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately whatever indicators are at desirable can be articulated through General Systematics and codified as Markov blankets to unlock the capabilities of semantically composable impact markets. These functional models can then be enriched with Active Inferencing to provide a more detailed depth of resolution.
Pilot Tokenomic Mechanism(s): Adaptive Capital&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The architecture above is designed at the level of general infrastructure and can be used for composing any desirable credit design, which is dependent on the articulation of parametric groupings instantiated around a use case or pilot project. These paramaters and the rules governing them matter significantly when scaled to the level community, commons or bioregion.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are already number of great projects in the Regen ecosystem that would stand to benefit from such composable designs and we’re keen to partner based on DAO capacity. LunarPunk Labs as proposal authors have a strong preference towards working closely with our existing partners at the charity Regenerating Sonora in order to build out a low risk pilot project. Conditions around them are exceptionally vital as they have LEHR gardens, a community centre with a blockchain learning desk and high school tech club working with Arudino sensors!
Basic Credits: Regenerating Sonora use case&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;Starting from the LEHR gardens, possibilities are assessed by a student group. 
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;It’s decided that the key step forward is to automate the gardens water timers. 
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;A group of local high school students automate the timers using their Arduino kits. 
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;Using the systematics interface Arduino data feeds are mapped as a ‘perspective’.
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;These are then allocated to a ‘language’ describing the storage mediums (e.g. Filecoin Green).
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;As the students add other sensors to augment the garden timers new feedback loops arise. 
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;These changes to the model are assessed using active inferencing; do the feedback loops suggest the gardens are growing better or worse with the new automation? 
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;Documented processes reporting improvements drives up the credit value. Assuming the local school holds a portion of tokens they stand to benefit from any speculative activity on their work.
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community Capital: H3 University use case&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example methodology our students might use to additionally codify the co-benefits produced by the communities vibrant social capital is the H3uni framework deployed on the current course “The art of creative collaboration”. This particular practice based methodology groups eight sets of parameters under four framing conditions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Framing conditions:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paramater Groupings:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular methodology is currently being demonstrated as both the H3uni course with video documentary evidence AND is being discussed amongst our teams on WeCo.io as a ‘weave’ (chains of 1min audio recordings &#x2F; 140 character cards in a sequence as a conversation graph). The data from this form of ‘prosocial-computation’ can all be anchored on a storage medium of choice using the Regen Data Module. You can keep up with the teams pretotype testing here.

          <description xml:base="https://joshafairhead.com/travel/olbia/">&lt;div class=&quot;cover-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Olbia&quot;src=&quot;grounds1.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving at the housing estate where our accommodation is located our hosts Josh and his partner Yada arrive with some supplies to sustain us a night before helping us search out the exact apartment we’re staying in and joining us a brief moment of socialisation before bed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eva and Pekko have never met him or Yada before but myself and Ome have a good idea of what to expect. The warm greetings turn into priming for the week and in comes the Sunday shock to clear some space for the rest of the week; an aggressive disregard of concepts lacking an agreed upon convention.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This change of temperature felt a little shocking but foundational context was getting set; we know only what we’ve been informed of and frankly much of that is nonsense. Josh demolishes any remotely abstract ideas that surface and proceeds to inform us about linguistic systems; the etymology and origins of the grammar we were using etc. - old territory for myself and Ome but foundational stuff. We retire for bed at around 1am on these notes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might say that Monday was largely an ‘informal practice’ of confronting Josh and trying to defend our ignorance - all the while being blatantly told of his meta-game (“domination”) and the playing field (“with words I create”). This is largely apparent to me, so I take a back seat in order learn from the interactions of others attempting to share opinions and information… and Josh’s vigilant rebuttal of their predications!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The style was certainly argumentative, but he gesture, form and delivery were all pretty considerate; in case we were to forget the game Josh was repeatedly informing us that words are tools and the intention behind their use is what really matters… don’t bloody forget, its important!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the game he would often explicate things like “I’m the emperor wearing no clothes” or “I’m overtly playing in the mud to demonstrate what your up against in this world”, just in case there was any confusion around motives… which of course happened at times!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these paradoxes, I found Josh pretty congruent in enacting his philosophy and despite his unrelenting ‘attacks’ on unsubstantiated opinion, the gestures made were consistently kind hearted. What a brilliantly controversial character! Heresy!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent most of this first day in discussion while moving between various locations in the grounds (coffee, lunch, walks etc.). Like the night before he was  trying to set foundational context about knowledge itself, for the sake of convention… Metalinguistics right?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;travel-gallery gallery-2 gallery-resized&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Grounds&quot;src=&quot;grounds1.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Grounds&quot;src=&quot;grounds2.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While sitting for coffee we encapsulated “what knowledge is” as five categories; synthesised information that is:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram1.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me this definition validated well through the geometric epistemology I use for ‘cognitive security’. The same can be said regarding a ‘dispute of predication’:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram2.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation then turns to understanding; for which Josh provides a triad of triads to outline the dynamics:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram3.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;travel-gallery gallery-3 gallery-resized&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram4.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram6.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Quite a deal was transmitted through our interactions and there were many gems; philosophical fragments of all sorts. Our conversation on knowledge and understanding moves us on to the study of deontology;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Deontic square being:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram7.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Deontic Star of:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram8.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deitic reference (here &#x2F; now)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Message (poetics)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Channel (phatic function)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code (meta linguistic)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaker (Locutory expressive&#x2F;denotive function)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reciever (connotive function)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Types of reasoning:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram9.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive progression:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram10.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on in the evening Moritz arrives from the airport just in time for dinner, Yada after just having picked him up; he seems a bit apprehensive so Josh greets him with an introductory statement along the lines “you look tense, is everything ok?”. There’s a little dance of getting to know each other for a bit and to my senses Moritz feels cautious of the scenario, choosing to remain aloof while hanging back on his chair but they are both civil and accommodating.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday feels like there’s a degree of polarity in the air; Ome’s working most of the day, Moritz is on the couch next to him making use of his phone, Eva has occupied herself cooking lunch, while myself and Pekko dig around in a number of subjects like technology, morality, eschatology, ontology, definitions, semiotics and so on. - yes I’m defending a hopeful future of the third horizon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch we head for a brief walk down to the church before returning to the porch for coffee in order to continue our discussions. Somewhere along the line a confrontation between Moritz and Josh emerges; for the former it’s an attempt at heart to heart interaction, for the latter it’s a demonstrative opportunity…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Outside&quot;src=&quot;outside.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moritz seems to want to build personal rapport before a meaningful engagement with Josh can emerge, but the latter playing things pretty formally. Without this foundational rapport Moritz fells unwilling to be led (or spoken over) and decides it’s time to try a new approach. Josh on the other hand is also unwilling to let anyone lead the conversation or be spoken over and consequently the pair get quite animated as they spar for their preferential operating conditions!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This uncompromising interaction is fascinating; as shits hitting the fan, I’m busy contemplating a mnemonic of the five speech acts that myself and Ome previously learnt from Josh on a prior visit (thumb: affirmation, index: accusation, middle: demonstration, ring: declaration and pinky: commisives). I practice identifying these modalities in real time and signal my interpretation to Ome with hand gestures - though he’s unfortunately forgotten the learnt convention. As far as I can tell Moritz seems primarily in the accusative and declarative modalities; while Josh seems deeply engaged in enacting the demonstrative modality…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram11.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This act builds into utter absurdity by the time Josh gets round to addressing egoic drivers (which may or may not have originated from an accusation); by loudly assuring Moritz “my ego is bigger than yours” and repeating “MY EGO IS BIGGER THAN YOURS” in response to any interjections…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to them both standing up and Josh gently demonstrates an energy exchange - ‘the action, passion and force’ - on Moritz’s person… before reassuring that “It’s all love Moritz, look it’s all love, I mean you no harm” and showering him with hugs in the process.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This switch of modality (into comissives) diffuses the situation as no one can take the interaction seriously at this point, they both sit down again and we continue with relatively peaceful interactions as Ome and Eva head off for a walk.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My theory is that this exceptionally odd dance was an opportunity for embodied demonstration; movement from patterning into potential for the purpose of retro-causal theoretical dissection. My own speculations aside, this is the first triad which landed in my notes directly after; assumedly related to the field of ‘Pragmatics’:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram12.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related to the demonstration followed the dyadic articulation ‘Energy’:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram13.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Followed by the triad of Transitive energy:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram14.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Intransitive energy:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram15.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the subject of energy we then moved into Rhetoric:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram16.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Essence: Convincing through the senses.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Existence: Convincing through reason.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three branches of Rhetoric being:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram17.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamics of these branches being:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram18.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Rhetorical field of action being:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram19.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the evening Josh recommends we take a break from discussion and watch something together on the porch; “a brave new world” by Ardous Huxley… This is far more entertaining than expected and seems to have a number of pretty cynical undertones to it; though it would seem that Huxley was seeing pretty clearly having cleansed his ‘doors of perception’.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a third of the way through the film Josh suggests we turn the movie off. I’m pretty engaged with it but others apparently less so; I can sense that something’s brewing just before Moritz decides to share some videos he sent me before.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having already seen these videos and noting a glimmer in Josh’s eyes, I decide to get the hell out of dodge. Yep, further confrontations; these offerings are nonsense, bullshit and ideological etc. - Josh is generally poking Moritz to defend his subjective sensibilities. I’ve died on this front line a few times already so I let the demonstration play out by walking off to throw sticks for the dog’s… who are barking at a hedgehog.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday we hang out around our breakfast table sharing a little about our various backgrounds before heading over for lunch with Josh and Yada at around 2pm. Eva and Yada have done all the cooking thus far so I offer to throw a quick pasta salad together and let them chill out while others also tend to their devices. Josh and Yada have already eaten and the former is looking rather tired today which enables us to continue at a more chilled out pace.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Outside&quot;src=&quot;outside2.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s enough of a breather for me to hang out on the couch for a bit, so I take the time to frame the eight attributes of ontology in an octad; a real diamond in the rough! According to Josh, the eight components of ontology that are covalent and coexistent ‘en sino’ (at once) are:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram20.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having taken a brief walk down to the church and back, I show him the mandala over coffee; which brings us into other related fragments - the correspondence between predication and attribution, and further linking back to the triad of quality, quantity and modality.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here we get into epistemology a little; the correspondence between reason and judgement, and the triad of deductive, inductive and adductive reasoning and so forth; yes - a systematic set is really starting to emerge!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I could figure out the full systematics of these topics however, we’d switched to reasoning and the “six types of question”; I’m not actually sure that “types” was accurate terminology as they were more “genus” but the hexadic geometry held together reasonably well:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram21.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next to this is an already known pentad of questions; which seem more appropriately termed as “species” (for whom being the predicate):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram22.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation was fragmented, so we move on to Truth as the triad of:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram23.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My notes indicate that we briefly moved back to deictics for a moment before traversing the conversational graph onwards; in particular Josh took a moment to explain the following triad of “speech acts”:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram24.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locutionary (physical and grammatical aspects that convey literal meaning)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Illocutionary (communicative function concerned with speakers purpose)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perlocutionary (impact, effect or outcome of speakers words on audience)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we moved back to reason or “where are you coming from?”:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram25.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually constructed through logical syllogism:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram26.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this juncture I notice a possible link between syllogism usually being a form of deductive reason - though it seems that there can be six permutations of a syllogisms layout - which opens up an interesting space for exploration.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance does the order of conclusion, minor, major result in abductive reasoning? I’ll need to do some experiments to determine the implications… but I can imagine that starting with a conclusion, arguing a minor and ending on the major may well correlate with ‘absurdist’ reasoning…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last triad of the day sees to be around etymology; prefix (head), radicle (body), and suffix (tail). I’m not entirely sure how this fitted in with the conversation but is still good to know. This is actually the last set of records in my notebook, though there were many more discussions and interactions centred around previously covered material.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Diagram&quot;src=&quot;diagram27.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I seem to remember Thursday being a fairly calm day with Josh and Yada turning up at our place in the afternoon for lunch before taking Moritz to the airport.
During a coffee session conversation turns to the term ‘love’. Josh exclaims “Love; oh, don’t get me started on THAT word - the use of the term is so wide that it encompasses the entire fucking universe”… though this aligns with his philosophy regarding the use of words to alter reality, it’s somewhat telling that his dog is called “Eros”.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he’s driving the point home I add some more controversy to the mix; that ‘love’ and ‘narcissism’ are two sides of the same coin. The former being open and free, the latter being a possessive or expectant variety.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Yada is kind enough to lend us their car for a group excursion and we head into Olbia town for dinner together. Parking is quite the difficulty as there are many hungry drivers in search of a space; sharks cruising around the lot, cutting in on each other and blocking out spots as they become available. The locals have quite the plurality of parking strategies!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We return their car on Saturday afternoon, before having lunch together in the hosting space which is to be followed by a loooooong walk up the mountain. I’m offered an LSD cookie but once again psychedelics are not calling me despite everyone else indulging; I’m becoming quite the trip sitter!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hike up the mountains leads us through all kinds of beautiful scenery, stopping at an old church ground before continuing up to the pinnacle our journeys most aesthetic view. Returning down the mountain (much quicker than when we climbed) we pass Yada in the car who’s off to get some of the tastiest potatoes I’ve ever eaten and some pizza as additional nourishment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josh shares a recording called the ‘Art of Fugue’ over dinner which opens the door for a youtube music night; theres a journey through some gospel music with the same chord progression as ‘Up on Cripple Creek’ by The Band, ‘Sympathy for the Devil’, ‘Man of Constant Sorrow’, ‘Father Son’ by Cat Stevens, and so on - theres even a bit of dancing!
Before leaving for the evening Josh wishes to demonstrate his metagame one last time via the analogy of pool; thinking ahead about positioning seemed to be the main point but also other players &#x2F; balls blocking the way, spin and how quantity effects quality.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;View&quot;src=&quot;pool2.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The next morning, we’re picked up around 12am and Pekko’s delivered with verbal shock about an hour before he’s taken to the Airport; Eva goes along as well to say goodbye as they seem to have become pretty close. The rest of us take it slow for the day and chill out - including Eva upon her return.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh seems to be celebrating a ‘perfect game’, an inference indicated by the classical music and fresh white shirt, worn as if to imply that he “played in the muck and didn’t even get dirty”!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Pekko and Eva depart, Ome leaves for a solitary wander while I continue to quiz Josh on various points that arose over the week in order to fill in any blanks. Eva returns and sits with us, at some point informs me that I’m “doing great”… possibly because my interactions with Josh are nearly entirely non-adverserial (so somewhat exceptional) and have lead to some reasonably constructive conversation!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ome comes back from his walk before heading for another with Eva as I hang back with Josh and smoke some CBD he kindly offers. This is the first time we’re actually alone together which is a shift from previous days; theres a sense of relaxation to our conversation - probably he’s also let go of teacher mode and I’m acting pretty parsimonious with my words.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a stillness between us which seems to make him slightly uncomfortable or perhaps even slightly anxious. He brings me in to watch some videos from a channel called “Babylon decoded” which is hosted by a pretty authentic Swiss Rastafarian. Conversation has moved into a more personal modality and I sense some concern about the world his daughter is embedded in so reassure Josh that there is still plenty of hope in the present moment; despite a mess the might appear pretty intractable!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ome and Eva return and we take the latter to the ferry; I stretch out from all the sitting while goodbyes are shared. After this we walk around Olbia for some people watching and a tour of social hotspots. We stop for drinks and pizza at the spot where Josh and Yada met before returning for the night; our AirBnB is gone at this point, along with the others so myself and Ome are permitted to stay in the guest house.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning we wake up for coffee and some final conversation before Josh and Yada drop us at the airport. I give them both hugs and before a depart by blowing a raspberry; a convention he joked about several times during the week - addios amigo, the lessons are much appreciated!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, before taking off, myself and Ome share a few minutes of retrospective before he leaves through security and I search out some food to “fill a gap”. It’s a long travel home via Tolouse and I land back in Lisbon around midnight, grateful to stop traveling at long last!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here ends the adventures of 2023!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;logo&quot;src=&quot;CCG.jpg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting to Austria is relatively relaxed; as I’m flying out of Pula Airport. I get an influx of messages from Moritz which internally liquidates some kind of blockage while I queue for security. Landing pretty late, I grab a hostel for the night and then move onward to the Commons Hub via public transport in the morning.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking to the hub I’m surrounded by beautifully tranquil rivers, meadows and mountains. I’m early for the conference by a few days, along with a few others so we spend the week getting to know each other juggling with various chores. Slowly other participants begin to trickle in for the gathering; a number of whom are relatively known from my various travels over the years.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;View&quot;src=&quot;view.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I settle in, the first person I speak with is Jelle; he’s interested in all kinds of things and asks for thoughts on the connectivity of his home studio setup. After dinner in the evening he’s discussing applied category theory with some others which I dial into. Eventually I ask if he’s talking about Statebox and it turns out he’s the progenitor; he begins to inform me of the beautifully complex theoretical underpinnings as well as some of the more metaphysical implications.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After discussing various wisdom and magical traditions with Jerome (I think Bhuddism was the trigger); I asked him about his more cosmic role in things and what brought him to this space. His answer was “vision, but not in an egoic kinda way - I don’t really talk about it much but ideas arrive in my head fully formed and then I only need to articulate and express them… I’m a game designer by trade”.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Woah, that’s a pretty interesting sense gate you’ve activated; I’m somewhat aphantasic myself - would you mind telling me more? Do you have any recollection of when or how this gate might have opened for you?” we sit down and begin to scratch these depths.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“yes, I think it happened somewhere around age five; my parents had split up and I found myself sitting on a fence asking ‘what happened before this?’ answering myself and then - like a five year old does - asking ‘what happened before that?’ over and over again… Eventually I reached the point of ‘I guess I was born… so what happened before that?’ at which point I began to imagine what I must assume to be previous lives”.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, if this ‘tracing the source’ was not fascinating enough, he goes on to say that this type of phenomenological experience didn’t resurface for a while until he was about age eighteen. He was apparently drinking with his buddies sate into the night, while also cleaning up his act and getting into meditation. Sleepless from an all nighter he found himself struggling to stay awake during meditation until something snapped, at which point a clear energy suddenly filled him - not unlike what’s been said to happen in formal Sesshin - after which he immediately drove home and had an out of body experience while lying on the couch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lying there he realised an ability to zoom in on a corner of the roof. Deciding to test this phenomena further he found was also able to zoom in on the opposite corner.  The perspective however was directly parallel to the first corner which should have been hypothenuse from his position on the couch…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wonder if I can look at myself?” “turning round, I see myself down below lying on the couch”. “At this point I realise I’m having an out of body experience and bewildered with awe, I decide to see if I can see out the window. I move towards the shutters to peer out where I can see the lawn and all the people moving about in the street”.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At this point I turn round and head back to my body, unsure if I can actually get back in or how to do that. Reentry is like pushing through a membrane after which I wake up and the phones ringing. Picking up the phone I say ‘you wont believe what just happened to me Margret’, who responds ‘how did you know it was me calling?’ as I’d just picked up the phone!”.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I kept this experience to myself until later in life as it was pretty strange to talk about. When having dinner with my aunt and uncle, my aunt started telling us about her out of body experience and so I shared mine from back when I was eighteen. My uncle didn’t know what to say when we finished and it was about this point that the visions started to come back again”. Dinner is served so we hop outside - what a frigging story!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;View&quot;src=&quot;view2.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My room mate Josh “the blockchain socialist”, is delightfully serendipitous in his sleep - randomly exclaiming comments like “oh no, not again!” once a night before settling back into his dreams. In the mornings he has no memory of the imaginal landscapes he’s traversing but we get a laugh from the breath of possible speculations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Josh&quot;src=&quot;slide1.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New people are arriving for the gathering the meme pool gets richer and richer; folks like Orion bringing the history of computation and interaction design and others like Daniel and Jorge bringing the philosophies and learnings of ECSA (Economic Space Agency). My dear friend Ome arrives, as do Art, Moritz and some of the Olbia contingent.
Jelle is going full Richard Feynmann with us; mathematically encoding my triads in a matrix and explaining topology - or more appropriately - the end of topology to us…
Here’s my recollection: topology begins with a point, which has no length breath or depth - infinity as emptiness - and turns into a line or vector between two points. The line then turns into two dimensional planes by connecting a third point, from which we can break out a dimension by joining edges.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we do this with a square it turns into a cylinder, and by inverting the edge connectivity we get a mobius strip. Adding another dimension to the mobius strip we get a Klein bottle - which we can also somehow fold to create a special kind of half sphere, that can also be paired with another to create a full sphere. Theres a problem to note with infinitely thin slices, but from here we can select two points on the surface of the sphere to get ‘the line of infinite projection’.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the distance between points on the line of infinite projection get closer to each other they become whats called ‘the single point of compactification’; a sort of infinite fullness thats a point with infinite length, breath and depth - is where the field essentially ends. Mind blowing stuff, kinda like the mathmatical recipe of god; a theme that would recur over the week.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;travel-gallery gallery-3 gallery-resized&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Topology&quot;src=&quot;topology3.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Such theme kept coming back predominantly due to Lio’s love of philosophy - in particular Hagel, encoded as a game he was calling ‘play’. Access to this game was through a deeply codified ChatGPT prompt about interfacing interfaces that change their shape from interfacing with each other. This prompt was a pretty potent brew for generating poetics and led to a number of fun GPT inquiries around the shape of shapelessness or the shape of all shapes, or perhaps even metatrons cube - idk, but it was fun.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other memories include a glorious massage circle that Shannon and Noemi started, which seemed to grow exponentially as people happened across it. I got pretty lucky as I initially had Shannon behind me who was intuitively zoning in on trigger points that needed some soft tissue work, after which I got Orion, a human power house to crush the knots in my middle back. If memory serves me well, there was a decent dance session to shake ourselves out again in the conference room initiated by Ome.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traversing the weeks more structured sessions were workshops by Matt Slatts on ‘money’ and Art Brock on ‘currencies’, both of which provided a lot of structured information for systematically encoding as knowledge in my notebook. Matt’s contribution was a week long course funded as an ECSA performance, while Arts workshops were more thematically in line with methods of ‘Agile Learning’ and so he tailored his talks to the audience in attendance. The latter had many beautiful diagrams of his own to draw on as content; which I compressed and codified for myself through the lens of General Systematics (see bottom of page for original slides):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The evenings were always eventful; one that comes to mind being the cybernetics ‘movie night’ presenting Cybersyn2023 and some other loosely related productions from Youtube. I’d already seen Cybersyn at Metaphorum but found it too dense for a single viewing so was only too happy that it came round again. The other screenings felt like memetically troublesome info-hazards; propaganda and subliminal brainwashing - highly salient computer graphics, strobe effects and other means of messaging that spike neural energy to create associations and indoctrinate the viewer with memetic ideologies. I quietly drew a pentad encoding the VSM on the flip chart for anyone interested and went outside.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; &lt;iframe title=&quot;vimeo-player&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;player.vimeo.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;572121732?h=ce39e438ff&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;    allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;&#x2F;iframe&gt; &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;VSM&quot;src=&quot;VSM-Pentad.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The events close was another interesting evening which came plenty of eventuality; most people were swaying so after a jam session kicking off some rythmic chaos, I decided to drift around the hub to see what was happening. Ome and Orion were into the AI eschatology discussing prompt injection and the implications of a post truth internet on society; ultimately demanding provenience tracking and encryption extended as deep as the hardware level and possibly beyond.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While sitting outside around the fire with Lio and GPT, ‘the green dot’ (a (LARP or psyop) wandered over and sat down with us. Those mimetically infected by the game were assuming tribal factions based on a sticker and then role playing the conflict into existence… or at least thats what seemed to be going on to those situated outside the memetic bubble. On that note don’t get me started on ‘the bubbles’! (iykyk)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another salient moment that come to mind from the gathering was getting called a ‘wise old gnome’ on the last night after walking with some friends as a DMT trip sitter. Talk about a flattering comment; I laughed and promised to bring a pointy red hat on my next visit!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning my friends Ome, Pekko and Eva departed to Vienna without me due to our travel itinerary and I made my own way to the flight a little later, meeting Ome at the departures terminal. We then rendezvous with the others during a transfer and fly onwards to Olbia together where an exceptionally grumpy taxi driver transports the final stretch to our accommodation; driving off with the boot open and while shouting at us in Italian about the windows…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Metafest&quot;src=&quot;metafest.jpg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a number of nudges from friends I pack my bags for MetaFest in Croatia. The gathering is in a ‘techno fort’ and because it sounds like we can camp up there, I decide to bring a hammock as my primary accommodation. I’m on an all nighter with a layover in Luton airport for a six am connection; arriving at 9am in Pula airport.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m knackered and every things off to a hard start; my phones outta battery and I’m facing a liquidity crunch again, unable to get internet to move some finance around to pay for a bus to exit the airport. Despite the perfect storm of contingency I’m loaned enough for the €6 bus fare and a breakfast bite.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the fort; “let’s figure out how to get there I think to myself”. “Awesome, an hours walk from the city with bags - ok let’s go” says my inner dialogue. About a third of the walk in, some travelling Italians see my thumb and pick me up. Bugger, the fort seems pretty closed and no one’s about. I plug into my solar charger to check and yes, people are elsewhere for the day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Castle&quot;src=&quot;castle.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Metafest&quot;src=&quot;beach.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I head down to the crystal clear water nearby, have a swim and then take a rest on the ground under some bushes - nowhere particularly good for the hammock. After a few hours I’m refreshed to large enough degrees and decide to sort out my contingency; after moving some things around on the internet at the stake house I have some funds in my bank again, and folk are heading to another fort to watch the Persied meteor shower at 8pm. As I depart the stake house a car stops for me; it’s Peter and a few others he’s dropping to the fort.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things feel a little more expansive on arrival. A fine plateau for viewing the landscape and watching the stars from later. I’m in good company; Fotis in particular shares a lot of interest in many of the domains I traverse and seems pretty transdiciplinary.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Sunset&quot;src=&quot;sunset.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are left to our devices for a couple of hours as Peter and Anita head off to pick up some other travellers. As the night trickles on, various others participants arrive for the show - namely my old buddy Kay and the metacartel crew. There are plenty of stars streaking across the clear night sky tonight!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around one or two in the morning we leave the fort to go various ways. Since I’ve no destination other than the trees, I ask if its cool to put up my hammock around a rented house and tag along for the walk.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out there’s no trees within the garden but across the road there is a good tree and a fence pole to hang out on, so I check about the spot with some of the Chilli crew and am given a go ahead to park up.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nights pretty cold so I don’t sleep well and when the sun comes up again at six I finally fall asleep for a bit. I’m woken up at 11am by an irate neighbour who’s threatening to call the cops if I don’t pack up, so I oblige and pull down the hammock. He’s actually the landlord of the Chilli house and blows a fuse when I stop in to grab my bag…  This ticks off one of the female members of the crew who proceeds to make a mountain out of a mole hill - it’s ok, the vibe was already kinda weird despite a number of cats like Ven who were pretty cool.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I book a hostel and hitch into Pula only to realise I booked it in another town called Farzana… both are equidistant from the fort in Stinjan so that’s ok, just a bit of a detour. I’m shattered and starving so get some breakfast and hit up a friend who’s around Pula for a touch in before figuring out the bus to Farzana at 5pm. Delirious I miss my stop but the driver is turning round anyway. At about 6pm Sunday I crash out hard in the hostel.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning I send out some messages to friends and get walking along the coast towards Stinjan. I get confirmation that Moritz and Thom will meet me later out at the Lost Bay beach bar; a beautiful spot with a doorway into the ocean and empty picture frames hanging from the overhead tarpaulin as if the walls and content existed. I’m significantly ahead of the others traveling from Pula - who are also walking&#x2F;hitching - so I grab some supplies from the grocery shop before doubling back.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Door&quot;src=&quot;door.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing some diagramming work on the beach I dip in for a swim and float around a while in the sun. Grabbing my towel to dry off I notice a guy next to me with a towel on his head getting changed - “Kay?” I exclaim, “Oh, hey!” responds the strange non-stranger, “I thought it was you”. His wife, who I hadn’t recognised, had also been stationed next to me just before my swim but she was unsure if it me… Kay was up at the fort until now and is heading for a dip himself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We exchange some words before he and his family head off to the camp-ground, while I remain stationed for another bit awaiting on friends to arrive. After some time Moritz appears by the sea-door and we settle into a respectful discussion as interlocutors. We’ve not really talked much in meat space, just occasional crossings and a call; I share some geometry in my notebook in relation to the worlds he traverses and he reciprocates with interests like his book and some AI tools he’s found.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some time, Thom shows up to join us as we close out our discussions. I find the energy somewhat disruptive to the gentle chat we were having before and he wants to meet others at the restaurant in Farzana (which is coincidentally on my itinerary). He starts to order taxis to make that happen, the first of which doesn’t show up but provides opportunity to say hello to Roberto and Laura as we’re near their camper van, which is parked in the go-karting field thanks to a deal with the owner. Claudio, his father, offers us some anise liquor which is accepted by my companions before were back on our way to the restaurant.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second taxi also takes a while to show but arrives this time, taking us to the Aborium in Fazana where the others are located. Amongst the faces are a variety of folks from previous lives like Lanski from my Giveth days and a few others - all of whom have eaten so we quickly order some food before the bar closes. A self identified libertarian is battles to pay the bill as he want’s to rid himself of his fiat currency; which I jokingly offer to take off his hands to which he he responds “would you like gold?”. “Sure; gold, silver, crypto, fiat are all good by me” I reply and to my surprise he hands me a gold leaf bill worth 1000&#x2F;th of a troy ounce which is worth about 90¢~.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The veggie burger I’ve ordered is extremely tasty and the company is lively (despite being a bit energetically scattered), though people are ready to leave. A very tired looking Moritz jumps in the van with Peter, Thom and some of the others for a spin back to Pula, so I head the stretch of 50m around the corner back to my hostel for bed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants are gathering in the techno fort the next day to make arrangements, so I walk over for approximately 2pm and lend a hand with that. I’m assigned dusting duty at the entrance so get on with cleaning some steam punk techno minions (who bite) and various decommissioned turntables before other odds and ends. The environment is pretty cool with its various nooks and crannies, so I take a wander about to see what else is around. Kay begins to set up his midi controllers for a sundown gig and turns myself and Fotis loose on his rig, smashing buttons and toying with the audio interface for an impromptu electro jam!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Hut&quot;src=&quot;hut.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few friends have arrived in time for the Chilli gathering that’s over by the camp-grounds so I walk over with a few people to say hello. Laurence is first person to spot me and I him; he’s just returned from a boat trip and pauses just long enough for me to recognise him (due to my myopia) and since he’s on crutches we sit down to catch up. Thom joins us and seems pretty keen to conspire so I leave them both to their conversation. Searching for another friend that has messaged me I bump into Rich from ChinWags so catch up with him and share the retrospective of his event that I wrote. He’s delighted!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving about a little I finally find my friend Jacek - an old college - and tangentially spot Stef&#x2F;Mars&#x2F;Marsita (a cosmic joker from the same epoch) doing pushups and rolling around on the floor. Jacek whispers to me that “Stephs just smoked a joint, so something’s about to happen”.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone suggests the Lost Bay beach bar just as I bump into my old buddy Lorenzo from Akasha hub, so we trek it over with a few others. Stef is too preoccupied with his act to recognise me - despite some pretty obvious hints like “I know who you are Stef” - before we get into a discussion by the bar.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s talking about hyperdimensional DMT geometry and cosmic everything so I share a mandala in my notebook which he brings over to the light; “you seem familiar from somewhere” he exclaims - just before the penny drops. He’s excited to see me again but also wrapped in a persona that’s pretty frustrating to interact with. Lovely guy at heart, I just wish it could shine through the mask more easily.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chill out with Lorenzo a little while longer before deciding to trek onwards for bed. He’s based at the campground nearby and decides to join me for the walk to finish our catchup. His calm and content energy is great for the walk under stars before we fork into different directions for the evening.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference begins at 2pm the next day - a time which happily allows me to rest well and still walk over in time for the opening ‘ceremony’. First thing on the agenda is a talk on the meta-crisis by Rob Morris, followed by “what it means to be radical” by Josh the blockchain socialist. After the initial talks are finished I spend a moment with Art Brock to see what he makes of the semantic mandalas I’m producing - particularly one in relation to the wider context of the Holochain arena. From there I’m largely just hopping into different rooms and chatting with people I know from previous lives, projects and epochs - which is whelming in an odd sort of way; the gathering feels like a really odd reunion!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day after I gave a presentation on some octadic mandalas which blows a few minds tickled the artistic and comedic preferences of James - an old friend of mine from travels in 2019 - who found it deadpan humorous.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;travel-gallery gallery-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Refi Octad&quot;src=&quot;octad1.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Metta Octad&quot;src=&quot;octad2.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the evening I join him and his friend Sal while they mentor each other on projects; to be honest James felt like he was bouncing back from something but was maintaining focus his on the operationalisation of TrojanDAO.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During their discussions I sketch out an enneagram based on their frame of performance, interpretation and inclusion. This specific triple was based on the more generic triad of DAO Alignment they had articulated as “mechanism, rules and guiding principals (values)”. Others who speak my love language! :p&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some social time flows from here before a session where I’m “touched by the light”; a magic light for neural annealing paired with breath work guided by Sam; plenty of octadic visuals this time round!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While tripping out in the visuals, I overhear a rather interesting discussion on Piercian semiotics with an exceptionally bright fellow called Benedictvs and join them after before moving to the fishbowl to dance alone bar a chair bound Laurence who’s shaking a leg pretty hard for a guy on crutches - if there were more people on the dance floor, he woulda totally dominated it despite his mobility!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we’re done shaking our demons out in the empty fishbowl, I’m about ready to depart for my hostel so help Laurence up and head back to the ground of intersecting highways; aka “the lobby”. After saying my goodbyes to various friends for the night, I head out to Laurences camper to share some mandalas and strategic insights - which he asks to record. One proposition I’m saucily suggesting is the loose formation of a WeCo Red team playing the game of capture and refactor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my personal view the app he and his partner James is working on is fantastic but also desperately needs a mobile first refactor, which he agrees on replying “do it, it’s open source - the question is who’s gonna do the work?”. I respond by suggesting that it would take agreements with people and point at the licensing issues; getting anyone involved with substantial capacity would require a MIT licence rather than GPL (the latter being hostile to commercial use and ‘tying balls to the project’ as others have articulated). He says it’s possible and that James would probably be open to that so we park the proposition for another time and go to bed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After walking over again the next day, a number of us warm up the unconference with evil laughter in the fishbowl! Maybe some lingering ghosts that myself and Laurence shook out the night before were present, as things got stupendously ridiculous. Regardless; there was much delight at this ‘vulnerability’ and a few contagious breakouts of genuine spontaneous laughter.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unconference planning started from here and essentially began with a discussion on ReligionDAO headed by Gustavo - under the gentle supervision of Art Brock - as religion can be a recipe for disaster but also potentially unitive force in the world. My contribution to that discussion was an assertion that neurologically religion is largely about desirable operating conditions and teleodynamic habbit loops; the sacred is simply the habbits which allow us to conserve our energy. I also chucked in a biosemiotic frame for holy ghosts as externalised impulses.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly after the ariel performance in the fishbowl, I donned my extremely loud radical love kimono with the intention of attracting attention and started sheparding as many people towards James’s workshop as possible… all the while wearing the digital name tag I borrowed from Stef&#x2F;Mars&#x2F;Marsita while pretending he&#x2F;she was beaming in from Berlin airport. I wasn’t really sure this act was working as it felt quite plastic to me but quite a crowd that joined for the final workshop of the unconf, so I assumed my work reasonably either effective or just plain lucky.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;travel-gallery gallery-2 gallery-resized&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Show&quot;src=&quot;show.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;James workshop&quot;src=&quot;james.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, before leaving for the night I spent a reasonably chunk of time interacting with Rob Morris about his story, my story, my mandalas, the Holochain conductor and the greatest “yak shaving expedition” he’d ever completed. It was a pretty good expedition; he showed me and Roberto the results!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existentially, Rob and his team at EthTokyo had built a pixel world with AI agents wandering the map; they had an 8-bit cartridge compiler, appropriately styled 8-bit graphics and some frigging awesome chip music as the cherry on top! Brilliantly ridiculous!!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gatherings now over and I’m gone; heading out the gate I say goodbye to various friends and then walk back to the hostel. I’ll spend the next few days relaxing alone in the water while occasionally bumping into fellow travellers, before making my way to Austria where I’ll see a many of the same faces again!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ad Astra! ✨&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Portugal: Boom Festival</title>

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Boom&quot;src=&quot;radicallove.jpg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some time at home on my own in Lisbon I make a last minute decision to attend Boom festival with Alex who’s attending with some friends. I pack my bags on the Wednesday and head out on the 6pm~ train to Castelo Branco; the closest stop on public transport. I’ve no idea how I’ll get to the festival 50km from the station but have my tent with me, so assuming the worst I can always camp in a field somewhere for the evening.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Train&quot;src=&quot;train.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The train is full of people heading to the same destination and I make  friends with some folk who are getting a taxi for the last leg of the journey. I’m with three Germans; a designer, his girlfriend and another guy who’s a loose end like me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we draw nearer to the festival there are cops blocking the road who proceed to flag our taxi down for a search. Three of us are largely left alone bar a pocket search but our loose end is checked thoroughly; he has some needles in his bag for a medical condition and no prescription with him along with some salts that are not for human consumption. They tear his bags apart to the effect of toothpaste explosions and ruined clothing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After passing through that rather intense energy wave it turns out that this poor fella has had a hell of a ride; the airline lost his luggage meaning that he had to sleep in the airport till the next morning to pick it up; his bags were found but the tent was lost.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Arrival&quot;src=&quot;arrival.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving in at like 01:00 we traverse the grounds to get set up at a preliminary camping spot. Johnny “no cash” - a friend of a friend - is on steward duty and points us towards some open ground where we can make camp.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stages are not yet open but I decide to take a look around the site; discovering the magic of the environment minus a crowd. The lack of activity is surreal; beautifully lit environments and landscapes with no one around and a still silence in the air - the peaceful serenity was one of my favourite moments of the week.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Art&quot;src=&quot;art24.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising the next day I grab a cold shower and get on with breakfast business before heading out to explore the grounds in the day; at this point I head pretty far out towards the edges and before tracing my way back in again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Settling into the Chi temple I lay back and allow my heart to fill with the soft energies in the air before dancing a bit to shake out the impulses I’m carrying. At this point a selection of muddy naked folk start to amalgamate to the left of the tent and are mindful of the carefully prepared sign stating “no mud!”. They begin to bend and sway to the wind and music like trees; it’s both beautiful and psychedelic.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my way back to the festivals epicentre I bump into my friend Fenix Stardust who’s out with some others looking for coffee so I join them for the walk and exchange a few impressions. He shares a story about some people that he’s just reconciled with as they had put him down at the start of his journey before assimilating parts of his narrative into theirs. Initially he was unsure how to feel about this but gracefully gave them the benefit of the doubt.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discussed the phenomena of impulse arbitrage across time and space as spirits moving between us as resonant vessels, highlighting the importance of grace at all times. What goes around comes around or what comes from source returns to source. He admitted that he was struggling with this expressing a sense regret for occasionally snapping at members of the tribe.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving at his crews meeting point just outside the supermarket before sitting down, he places a bunch of oranges on the table for people to pick up and take freely. A few others arrive and some take an interest in the geometries in my notebook - which brings me into a discussion on water.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m offered an exchange for some mushrooms which I turn down, though others take up the offer before we head towards the ‘temple of boom’ for an act called highlight tribe; a melting pot of pretty much every genre you could think of - psytrance, blues, swing, jazz, didgeridoo and so on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take the opportunity to get ecstatic, thoroughly shaking out the matrix before bumping into Ilias from Geneva, who informs me that he’s looking for a few other friends I know from that neck of the woods. Having exhausted all the resonance in my system I head off for a tour of the other spaces before heading back to my camp to put on some trousers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m barefoot at this stage and take a shortcut over the hill, which turns out to be covered with thistled leaves from the trees overhead before heading back out to grab some food and tour the grounds at night - hitting up the sacred fire stage to relight my flame.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On return I decide to take a counterfactual path back and am led up a hill past ’yellow camping ’where the path ends - so I trek over the grounds tripping on tent wires on the hill before finally emerging at a resting site close to my tent. I take a moment to have a smoke with one of the stewards on duty and discuss music before heading off to bed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Grounds&quot;src=&quot;grounds.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waking up Saturday morning, I prepare for the day with a cold shower and head out for breakfast before going for a long walk on my own again. While exploring I receive message from Alex letting me know that she’s arrived and is about fifteen minutes from the grounds.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I head back up the trail to meet her and help transport some of her luggage and set up her tent in ‘yellow camping’, which has much flatter ground than where I’m presently parked. Tasks completed, we depart for an orientation session of the grounds that she’s not yet traversed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Smell&quot;src=&quot;smell.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a swim in the lake I take her past Alchemy to the Sacred Fire and outer limits before ambling back through the being fields, ducking into merchant stalls and checking out the food stops together.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way we spot an incredibly cosmic kimono and stop in to look at some of the stores offerings. One of the store owners hovers behind me and suggests I’d look good in a full length as I pull out a particularly interesting specimen. He suggests I try it on and yes this radical love kimono looks great, especially with my hat, but upon learning the price we depart. I feel a hole inside - fuck; I’d already fallen in love with it. We make it most of the way back to the food stalls before my frugal brooding is so obvious that Alex kindly offers to cover half as a birthday present so we double back and pick it up.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Kimonos&quot;src=&quot;kimonos.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tour back through Alchemy stage before returning to enable her to rest at the tent - while I head off to pick up my own belongings and shelter. I say good bye to the Germans and suggest that we’ll likely be around the Alchemy stage in the evening. An hour later I’ve got my tent setup up again and bags stashed, so wake the sleeping Alex to grab some food before an evening dance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alchemy is pumping and the kimono seems to attract some new friends on the dance floor. After moving through a few spots we hustle on to the main stage which has turned into a psytrance swimming pool that we decide to paddle through for the experience. On our way back to the tents we visit the ‘misty projections’ on the lake shore; a bunch of organismic DMT shapes projected through smoke machines with ambient surround sound. Pretty cool installation!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;travel-gallery gallery-2&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Lazers&quot;src=&quot;lazers.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The next day I lie in while Alex goes off to the supermarket to grab breakfast, charge her phone and get some writing done. By the time I make over to the meeting spot she’s gone - so I head towards the music to raise my energy with a bit of a boogie. After a half hour or so I’m done and just as I decide to move on I’m greeted by a bouncing early bird who’s spotted the kimono and is finished with her own priorities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We head back in to Alchemy for a bit more dancing and swim about in the crowd for a while before I spot a juggler and move towards them. Another with clubs appears nearby next to whom I notice a slyly smiling Fenix who’s already spotted me. He offers me “a shamans dose” of mushrooms which I accept before making arrangements to meet Alex at the tents for six, before departing on a solo trip for the day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wandering to the far outskirts of the festival grounds I begin my journey and arrive as the mushrooms are starting to kick in; baked from the sun I find a small patch of shade to lie under. A few feet away from me is a tiny pavilion with some gospel (style) musicians sharing the love; I’m melting and occasionally weep from the cathartic nourishment. As the harmony fades into natural ambience another call from the Being Fields summons me to move closer to its beauty.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lying down, I once again let the harmony wash over me as the musicians lead a choir in praise to Lakshmi. I lay here for a bit before the music ends and head up through the fields to emerge near the Sacred Fire.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stopping between some bike racks to roll a cigarette I hear a tortured fiddle weeping. It has the timbre of nails scraping across the chalk board of my soul and is unbearably pure in its essence; my upper chest opens up in sympathy to the expression and my feet drag me to the over to the sound check to clear out my heart chakra.
As the music fades once again I head past the Chi Temple of sensual bodies moving and swaying on my way to the water. Stripping off off for a dip in the lake I find myself surrounded by numerous beautiful women swimming around topless like mermaids of the sea; a sailors paradise!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back on the shore shore I’m extremely moved by the beauty of this place. Wondering about how this landscape of music, people and plants came to be, I find myself considering it’s initial conditions and generator function in relation to Ashbys law of variety; what kind of soul(s) have the internal complexity and coherence to give rise to this beautifully ordered plurality? It’s certainly a very pure essence.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;travel-gallery gallery-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Lake&quot;src=&quot;lake.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Fruit&quot;src=&quot;fruit.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On the move towards the Chill Out Gardens I circle past the main stage and up to the Heart Box for a smoothie, before weaving back through the courtyard for some food. At this point I’ve nearly landed from my trip and am about ready to head back to the tent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s about an hour before six so I grab an ice tea before my return; no sign of Alex though so I sit about playing my guitar for a while and go to refill my water. At about quarter to six she arrives in from her expedition a little early and since I’ve my guitar to hand I improvise a brief song before we head off to get some food, taking the guitar with me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We settle in some shade near the lake and someone wishes to borrow my guitar, which I give to them while Myself and Alex chat about the day. Another traveller interrupts us to say hello and tell us of his travels before offering us some Mescaline which we procure from him to plan a trip. As he departs we notice there’s a rather saucy circus show happening over near the water. My guitars returned and we head over watch the hoola-hoops and a lady performing acrobatics on the silks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Plains&quot;src=&quot;plains.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the show disperses a mad man accosts us with gibberish about his humming birds and umbrella, obviously to get some attention as I’m carrying a guitar - what he really wants is a song. Alex splits while I sing him a verse of ‘the weight’ and am rewarded with a cheap humming bird keyring for the trouble… I attach this to my guitar strap and aim to catch up with Alex, after some time serenading folk in line for the toilet expecting her re-emergence I determine that she must have gone somewhere else before busking my way back to the lake. I meet another strangers curiosity and improvise a tune for him and his wife before being found by Alex once again. At this point it’s getting dark so we return the guitar to the tents and head out to meet some companions near ‘Lunched Out Lizards’ in the Garden.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After grabbing some chai tea we settle into a cosy seating area surrounded by a comfortably large twisting log. Most of our companions are on MDMA but we share some convo and a massage circle before they depart for a dance at another stage.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A this point Alex is tired so I drop her back to the tent and then head over to the Sacred Fire to catch the band I encountered a little earlier with the heart wrenching fiddle. The gig was an eclectic mix of world music and visual art marking a graceful end to a beautiful Sunday.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday we decide to take the mescal that cosmos delivered the day before, so after the morning ritual I meet Alex at the supermarket and purchase a watermelon slice to fuel my morning. We then weave ourselves through the pirate market and up to the Gardens to get some hot water from Lizards. After an attempt to station ourselves in some hammocks, I knock over my warm water and get some more before moving to the being fields for the day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find the ideal shady spot under a tall tree beside a nice big rock and to plant ourselves down to take root. Using my bed cover as a ground sheet we mix the powder and hot water before drinking the somewhat acidic brew.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ceremoniously we read a little poetry and wait for the effects to take hold. Narrating the trip a little Alex asks “do you feel like a cactus?”, to which I emphatically affirm “yes I do! I hadn’t noticed until now but I really do” - before we fell apart laughing. “I feel like mescal is a pretty still and grounded energy, like taking root in a desert” she affirms herself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly I feel like a desert plant, a male spikey thing optimised for survival in harsh conditions. She may have considered the energy she received similar but for me it was like having a delightful little bird land on my shoulder, chirping away with observations about the plant life and trees.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no moving us; we’re literally planted for hours and quite happy with the sounds of asynchronous wind chimes made of wood, rustling bushes, insects and the wind. At some point in our journey one of our friends from the previous night passes, sharing a few minutes with us. I don’t remember much of the conversation or anything other than that she was wearing some home-made earrings made of sparkly dinosaurs…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the sun becomes less intense we hold space for each other to move around the being fields without giving up our rock and shade as we settle from this wonderfully cleaning experience. I grab us some food to eat before departing for elsewhere and passing the Boom council we observe that reading instructions are extremely taxing. Seems in this state we cannot be informed!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our adventures for the day are pretty much over at this point so we head back to the tents, get some food and go for a wander around the festival grounds finishing the evening off with some chai tea before heading to the lake to watch projections in the smoke.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday Alex desires to take a mushroom trip alone so after meeting some friends at Lizards around the garden we part ways. I make it my priority to go for a dip in the lake and explore the other side of the grounds so my feet take me over to Funky Beach where I sunbathe naked and tend to some messages.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deciding myself comfortable in birthday attire, I head back towards the main grounds only putting clothes on again as I approach the epicentre, and only due to a need to load some credits onto my wristband. While looking for food I discover a place selling juicy Omelettes in crispy bread and return for a second helping before returning to the tents for a 6pm rendezvous.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex seems largely sober at this point so we head over to the lake shore and find a nice chill out spot to catch up on our day. Conversation ebbs through a few subjects and somehow lands on triangles; during which something I say upsets her terribly - which I believe to have been related to directing ones own formation - so I shut my trap and just console her. She comes round again to laughing at the situation, giggling sweetly about her upset and probably nowhere near as sober as initially assumed!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We grab some noodles and another omelette before heading over to the Sacred Fire to see what’s happening around the being fields. On our way there we decide to swim through the dance temple, which is particularly weird tonight with an archetype we termed “the cosmic joker” on the decks; chaotic good as the puppeteer of an insanity circus… pure ludos driving what appeared as mania.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrive at the Sacred fire, a sense of fragmentation becomes apparent; there’s a guy on stage going full Jim Morrison with improvised poetics about the ride of life, which sound’s exactly like Rick and Morty getting shwifty…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laughing our asses off at the evenings energetics we follow our trials back past the dance temple (which is grounding back into normal abnormality) and then up to the Garden. The vibe here has become similar to alchemy, while alchemy seems to have transformed into hard minimal psytrance. Something’s in the air tonight!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our last day on Thursday is spent taking things pretty easy; Alex is wiped out believing herself to have sun stroke from her Wednesday explorations. I leave her in her tent while I go for a wash and while returning from the showers I bump into some friends from Geneva who are leaving early to beat the traffic; I knew they were around but found it a shame we only bumped into each other as they were leaving but I guess synchronicities like that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I return to pick Alex up from the tents and we head towards the shade of the being fields to get some smoothies beside the sacred fire. Ducking into an underground seating area to avoid the sun we find some Irish lads having the craic with whoever’s around them; seemingly they’re going pretty hard on the wine and also just took MDMA so they’re bit much to handle, yet also friendly and entertaining.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They give me their glasses to claim the refund back from the wine bar, which turned out to be non-refundable, so I leave those at the counter and return to the under ground bunker with some food.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we pass our mescal rock again, the realisation that I never experienced the joys of becoming one of the mud people. I figure Alex can lie down in the Chi Temple while I coat myself and go for a swim after but she’s unable to handle the music and find some nearby shade instead before I leave to coat myself in mud.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually a pretty disappointing experience as, by now, the pool is mostly empty of thick stuff and has largely turned to stony brown water. I do what I can with the resources available before heading to the lake to wash off again and collect Alex.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we walk back to the centre, we stop to get coconut water for her and we Chai from Lizards for me. Around the corner I find a funk band has setup in the space between stages so we stop for a while to enjoy them. I note that the singer sounds like the same guy that was getting shwifty at the sacred fire a few nights before; though they seem more coherent at this point - defiantly a lot less drunken galactic super genius.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We grab some food and a lemon aid before an wander which is probably the most ‘collected’ evening of the week; main stage has shut down and Alchemy has taken over the primary directive of tribal psytrance. The gardens has a new groove to it that’s more energetic but not too hard and before long I bring Alex back to the tents to recover from her ‘sun stroke’ before one final exploration of my own!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I coast around I notice a sense of grace present that wasn’t available before; so I walk past the Sacred Fire to the edges of the being fields and through them. There are various closing ceremonies happening in each of the tents; I stop for water and end up walking beside a girl who comments on the sense of peace and stillness before tiredly parting directions for me to check out the foggy projections one last time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my surprise the smoke machines are gone and the projectors have been moved; theres now a highly pressurised fountain in their place with a much larger surface area of spray for visuals. Walking close to the shore, I stop for a while to watch some tango dancers informally putting on a show, who after some time sit to watch the projections as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman tripping on acid walks into the shallows to perform as a naked silhouette before playing with the pressurised fountain; messing with the spray to warp the visuals - all the while shaking her thing in an exaggerated manner. Soon enough an accomplice (in white shorts) joins her to mess about in the water for a bit and coordinate on the performance. It kinda works between them but also had at least an element of cringe as well; not sure it was really much my kink but they did a reasonably job replicating the ‘flirty fairies’ phenomena some people experience while tripping. Guess that was their archetype!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the clock strikes midnight, I head back to the tents to retire for the evening. Alex intends to be out super early but it doesn’t pan out that way so we casually pack up before searching out the Castel Branco bus.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again I’m playing guitar and quietly free styling in the queue, when one of the girls next to us starts to compliment the humming bird that’s hanging from my strap - the one from the kinda weird guy that stopped us on Sunday. I respond by saying “ok, well it must have been for you then” and detach it to give to them. She seems delighted with the gift, which I’m only too happy to give away as Alex knowingly giggles to herself about the exchange.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the bus I’m seated next to an ex-protugese lady who now lives around Devon. She’s been up all night tripping ’till sun rise before kipping in a hammock, so absolutely delightful company while on the bus. As we get off in Castel Branco she grabs her bike from under my bags and heads off on her merry way for coffee.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without much concern for departure times myself and Alex seek out an Indian to nourish ourselves and then make haste back to the bus terminal; her journey home starts as soon as we reach the terminal but I’ve still a couple of hours to go before the train. Consequentially I park myself at the station cafe and make a friend while sitting for coffee.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally arriving back in Lisboa, I take the long way home before dumping my bags on arrival and collapsing; I’ve about a week before my next stint of adventures start with other travels…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ad Astra ✨&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Solstice&quot;src=&quot;solstice2023.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Metaphorum enven in Manchester, I fly to Geneva for the Summer Solstice gathering in organised by friends at bonfire.link; a metaphor for life and an affirmation of the human capacity to self organise without calcified structures.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving pretty late on a Tuesday evening I make it across town to join a gathering at about midnight. Planning has been on the agenda but I’ve missed the show. Naturally coming from abroad and having missed all the meetings I lack the necessary context to effectively contribute, so I follow my friends lead in regard to preparations.
Setting off the day before we grab a projector from his basement along with some other items and head towards the tram outside to pick up a van. This is plan is a non starter as our station has become a final stop. There’s a womens march in the middle of the city blocking the trams continuity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind me a girl getting off the tram seems to become dizzy, starts to fall over and grabs my bag for support. As I work out what she’s up to her friends step in to catch her. Thankfully we’ve already put the projector down or that would have been a write off for everyone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are we doing now then? Matt the van owner can’t actually drive it because he has no licence and a broken arm so as heavy as the projector might be, we’re gonna have to lug it across town to find transportation on the other side. We can manage; I’ve carried heavier up stairs before despite the health and safety regs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halfway through our roughly 30 minute walk we end up in a Mexican stand off with another guy carrying a heavy fan before we finally make it to a tram going the right way. Ome’s clearly been wearing the sombrero in anticipation of this moment. Arriving at our destination we are greeted by Matt who’s thankfully brought us one of his many many trollys!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Matt&quot;src=&quot;matt.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landing at his house several hours later than intended we have a brief a sit down to catch our breath and begin to load the van with all kinds of things; fridges, lights, pallets, boxes, decorations, couches, beer, guitars, kitchen sinks - you name it!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Van&quot;src=&quot;van.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of particular difficulty was the fridge from the basement and the pallets from the balcony but we got everything in and then fired off to grab some bean bags and shelves from another spot…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After sevral hours drive to Verbier, we arrive at our destination and set up one of Matts tents. A nearby rock serves as a table to slice some bread and cut up some spring onions; slathered with cream cheese our 3am snack was sweet and nourishing!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;travel-gallery gallery-2 gallery-resized&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Dinner&quot;src=&quot;dinner.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Tent&quot;src=&quot;tent.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re completely wrecked the next day but there’s still a lot of stuff to get done; we need to load out the van for starter but there’s more to the story than the items we’ve brought - there’s a caravan on the dance floor and the guy living in it didn’t even know we we’re coming…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily he was related to one of the people involved in the parties organisation and an extreamly graceful fella; he literally calls up his mates and has them tow away his home for the weekend… The DJ booth and sound system arrived shortly after this which we place along with some tables.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I notice a rather drained Ome heading up the hill to fall asleep on a bean bag in the chill out zone. I help with some kitchen arrangements for a while longer but am also pretty badly written off so decide to crash out in the shade as well. Arising a few hours later, things seem to have arranged themselves under the artful guidance of Lila’s directive agency. The sound system is on, the DJs are playing and there’s a fully stocked kitchen commons… Chirst on a bike, things actually panned out.
Around 9pm or so we gather for a meal and to share some words and affirtations in relation to why we came to the festival, what we wished to give and what we wished to recieve. I’m just here for the food and drugs really, despite my interest in the groups evoloution. This kickoff Thursday was probably the most intimate of the days and to my tastes had the best music to boot. Check out some of the sets and see validate according to your own experience though:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point in the journey the foundations we’re all in place and so further work was largely decorative additions and comforts; lights, carpets, posters etc. beautiful food too as well of course!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;UV&quot;src=&quot;uvlights.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday morning I help out with some decorations; mainly putting in some fence poles to hang lights on leading a path to the chill zone. The company is good making the task of smashing things with a sledge hammer a lot of fun and easier than one would imagine. Of course we completely mess up the distancing but manage to finesse the mistakes into something that looks pretty decent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Freedom&quot;src=&quot;campfreedom.jpg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point in the day I make friends with a fella called Rob who’s got a game called “Spike Ball” with him. It’s a team sport of two on two where the first team serves to the opposition by bouncing a ball off a trampoline kinda thing. There’s then three ‘touches’ allowed to keep the ball in the air before it has to be returned of the trampoline. However one team member is not allowed to touch the ball twice and has to pass to their team mate. Bloody addictive game!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit it was extra fun playing spike ball with those who had consumed psychedelic substances for obvious reasons. Some of them were more attuned to the game, and others just couldnt keep their shit together and were just damn funny. Pure jokes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 9pm we gather under the gazebo for the second ritual; which is to say some light logistical announcements about water conservation and being respectful to the land we are on. We then share some silence which commedically ends with the sound of someone opening a beer signalling time for a dance!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around midnight the cops show up to temporarily disrupt my friends DJ set. The amusing thing with self organised raves - especially private parties on private property - is that the lack of codified authority is extreamly slippery for the hedgemony to grab while searching for the ‘one throat to choke’.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Cops&quot;src=&quot;moloch.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cops were fairly reasonable in the end and probably only hoping to be offered a drink but it would have been rather interesting had they decided to flex any further than their request to ‘turn the bass down a little’.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sound engineer had been keeping the volume within regulation all evening and recording snapshots with a digital dB meter. And hey even if the rig was over the limit how would they prosecute a spreadsheet? Luckily there was no need to find out.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday was gloriously sunny, and though I was a bit ill from the weather I held a workshop of geometric sense making which confused and delighted others. Down at kitchen, I’m offered a quarter tab of acid before taking my ass up to the chill out zone again. On the way back up a lively friend joins me for the walk, asking rhetorically “who’s playing guitar for the people; is it me? yes, ok, of course I’ll sing and play guitar for you all!”.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet harmony - the guys a fantastic entertainer! I’m feeling kinda fragile and slightly whelmed for whatever reason, probably too much exertion but the musics nourishing and while coming up on the LSD I feel patterns moving beneth my skin which animate my spirit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point things begin to become rather archetypal; the acoustic chill out spot has become camp freedom of the rebel alliance led by captain Norberto singing redemption songs, while bondage for liberation is happening down near the techno soundsystem.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;travel-gallery gallery-2 gallery-resized&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Jam&quot;src=&quot;freedom.jpg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Bondage&quot;src=&quot;bonding.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paradox is palpable to me; we have trippy hippies bound together in escape, while the folks below are literally tying themselves up to find liberation. Affirmers and deniers chasing the same ends in opposite ways. The beauty and sadness of this juxtapositon stirrs something in me as I lay in the middle ground listening to the forces of complimentary polarity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I start to level out and head down to the main area and am asked to help with the structure for later burning; which is getting constructed by some folks who are just a little bit off their faces and struggling with cardboard and twigs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I depart to find some string and bring it back to the project team which increases their effectiveness by about 400%. They are having fun regardless and at some point someone asks me if I’m an engineer. I say kinda and return the question, which recieves a positive affirmation so I ask them to take over with the string.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the totem somewhat on course I’m given some postit notes and pens by my friend and asked to heard some cats; get them to write something on the paper for burning later. I ask what exactly and propose something they are letting go of; “that will do” he responds somewhat flippantly and points me to some helpers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cracking on with this coordination task, I have some rather trippy experiences interacting with folk. My reality tunnel broadens and narrows with my various interlocutors as I connect with them and assimilate fragments of their world views. I notice that some of the more tripped out folk sober up and land a bit upon connection with me. My sobriety became their sobriety. Their spin became my spin - is this an after glow of the acid from or a repeatable phenomena? It’s repeatable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I go about this experience I also realise my initial framing of ‘letting go’ is a personal bias and that some people would rather make a wish instead so I update my rhetoric. Certain people are somewhat resistant te me aiding the culty ritual sending sarcasm and ridicule my way. I feel you fellow denier; the affirmation of narrative and ritual are indeed rather culty activities but upon such a recognition (and through the dissilusionment) we must attempt to move into post-nihilistic space or everything will cease to exist; affirm the positve to grow essence before negating the negative to realise the possible… this is just how it works.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage it’s nearly 9pm so despite some minor resistance from friends up at camp freedom everyone is ushered towards the fire for a sermon on the mount.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, things are turning monty python very quickly; my friend is standing on a mount above the fire pit with a sheep skull walking stick and a microphone to amplify his haggared voice. “Everyone shhhh, Ome’s lost his voice” someone yells. “What? Ome’s a very naughty boy?” I yell back as my contribution to the show.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;travel-gallery gallery-2 gallery-resized&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Sermon&quot;src=&quot;sermon.jpg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Mount&quot;src=&quot;mount.jpg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly the show really doesn’t need my help; everything is perfect already and the scene is about as brazen as it gets. Graciously, through a barely audible croak the prophet speaks; “todays ceremony has to do with fire”… “FIRRRRRE!!!” echoes a well intentioned attendee; who inadvertantly triggers a coordination failure as the totem is rushed onto the fire by its tripped out creators to much laughter and applause.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend rolls with the chaos as gracefully as always, though the raucous crowd is pretty hard to be heard over - few are listening. Notes are burnt on the fire before instructions can be properly articulated and people are kinda doing as they please.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a hardy spirit that unwilling to give up the ghost; I’m saddened to see the lack of care shown by attendees - my friends taken his fair share of damage from spearheading all this and at this point seems utterly haggared. Folks are shouting over what would otherwise be a rather sentimental moment and many seem almost gleeful to jump into the spotlight. I get it man, fuck the king right?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of comedic shit slinging the unCeremony receds back to dancing. I shed a few tears at this point as I’m personally aware of the efforts needed to sustain such an affirmation when there are challengers at every corner. Shake it off, celebarte - for tomorrow it’s over and we share a last supper…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packdown is easier than load in, which is often the case with events. Around 2pm the group gathers for some food a last supper where my friend lets the group know he’s no longer gonna push forwad as a leader, sharing that those he started with seemed to fall away over time. Indeed the burden of responsibility felt palpable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Endings&quot;src=&quot;endings.jpg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The king is dead, long live the king.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It will either be a funeral or a rebirth, I do not wish to watch things fade and will activly try to kill it if people don’t take over; you are welcome to try and stop me”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that we finish tidying and head home for some well earned rest. I remain in Geneva a few days longer for a Tuesday gathering and then fly back to Lisbon for a hackathon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ad Astra ✨&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Metaphorum&quot;src=&quot;elephant.jpg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of weeks at home I’m ready to traverse the reality graph once again; I’ve been figuring out my next token and from a number of options presenting themselves I decide I’d best be of service heading to Metaphorum in the UK.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly this means missing Playdrive and Let Me Think, the latter of which I’d already turned down due to budget but the former, held in the Commons Hub Austria, was really calling out! I’d have loved that one as all work and no play makes Josh a dull boy; you know it, I know it and damn playing with Laurence and seeing some old friends again would have been incredible!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all this I head to Manchester to learn from the Stafford Beer transmission and those following his lineage; I honestly don’t know what I’m in for but colleges from H3uni.org are attending and it seems like the important schelling point; John Hicks is presenting on designing for accessibility and Ian Kendrick is part of the organising team. Before I get too far ahead of myself - here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metaphorum.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2023&#x2F;06&#x2F;Metaphorum_2023_programme.pdf&quot;&gt;Programme&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-1&quot;&gt;DAY 1&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving on time for the first days kick off I receive a friendly greeting at the front desk from Ian and John who further introduce me to Jon Walker, a lovely older gent working on the organising committee with Ian.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within minutes of my arrival though the conference is starting with the welcome address, followed by Angela Espinosa’s presentation “Viability through emancipation – learning from VSM practice.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exposition highlighted her VSM work within grassroots organisations and for me served as decent aspirational target since she’d helped numerous organisations reform and refine their practices to become reduce their overheads.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After this you can see the programme bifurcated into two tracks running in different rooms and I chose to stay in the main hall with Robin Asby who was talking on “Designing Democracy; a systemic blueprint for governing”. This was a fine presentation on the core tenants of the Viable Systems Model and how we can look at government and nation states through such a lens.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a break for sandwiches, I decide to stay on in the main room for Johns presentation on accessibility. The key points made here was that without paying attention to accessibility a large part of the environment is excluded, which in turn limits internal variety also. Slides below.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following Johns lead was Trevor Hilder with a presentation on “Why the VSM is the organisational physics of sociocracy”. Having become a director on the board of equal care coop (mission circle) he realised that the underlying principals which enable Sociocracy to function are those of a VSM. Through such a pentadic lens Trevor was also able to map the coops existential structure to its implicit essence; or what he called “the moral modalities framework” - interesting!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After another break chatting with some of the younger participants, we’re drawn back inside. I make a deal with John to attend the workshop of dissent upstairs with Joe who I was just chatting with, while he attends the GPT workshop in the main hall. For whatever reason my feet rather quickly lead me back down to the man hall; I guess it’s because I’ve learnt plenty about dissent in the last years and while Joes PhD work is bound to illuminate some blind spots my inner geek really just wants to make LLM go brrrrr so I head down to the AI crowd to see whats shaking.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our table is beautifully diverse; John Hicks is holding accessibility in mind, Benjamin Taylor is thinking about technology, Joan O’Donnell with LLMs for trauma response and critical debriefings - and myself as ad hoc facilitator &#x2F; note taker (aka guy with markers doing the framing). This was a fine old amble across conceptual space that seemed to coalesce to some degree on paper:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up in the main room was a presentation that was probably most adjacent to the enrichment of my own interests; Stephen Davies on “accessing the zone of emergence” - where he shared many specific and relevant insights from running syntegreations. My fire lights up on this jam and gets me enthusiastic as I realise when orthogonally mapped that this is an applied form of John Bennetts Systematics; which I can use to specify all kinds of protocols with directed intentionality! Phew!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When designing for emergence of new levels of social cooperation at scale these are the conditions (according to team syntegrity)
Convene a set of agents that agree to a bounded domain and set of rules.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infoset&#x2F;participants are engaged based on interests or knowledge relevant to the opening question; the focal point of convening or agent selection.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participants drive topic space &#x2F; agenda development. Members, critics and observers have specific rules of engagement throughout team meeting.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Process of task activities is prescribed; both for agenda setting and meetings.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agents must experience working across three levels of recursion simultaneously.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each person arrives in their own personal identity. They receive team identity and engagement paths through the meeting&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each person is a member of two teams. They act as a critic in two meetings, a critic in another two and observer in four. Role overlapping is critical for info sharing and feedback loops.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teams return to plenary session at key points in the day to anchor the group identity at full scale.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agents must work in a continuous process with a minimum of three iterations in rapid succession&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Field setting and grounding in the current realities of the agents. “What is”.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focused on possible futures and generates options for consideration grounded in realities of iteration one. “We could”.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focused on preferred futures and teams generate a priority set of preferred or recommended actions based on the possibilities generated in round two. “We should”.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this session ends I head upstairs to Ian and Alleannas workshop to participate in the VSM game they’ve organised. Groups are sat at different tables and tasked with a scenario where three sisters are managing a family business. Each group represents a system ‘tier’ and must coordinate with other tables based on their role. It’s pretty tough to get a grasp on this transitional object as there is a lot of information and I’ve not yet memorised the VSM but the games a rather illuminating scenario none the less!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point in the day its time to hit the pub, which is where I learn about the history of the LETS (Local Exchange, Trading, System) space from John Waters; a veteran for the softwhere sphere and VSM spaces. It was pretty interesting to work through his logic regarding forms of money and values as I’ve swam in similar waters and even encountered many of the folks he’s worked with in the years gone by.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lively discussion on this topic I ended up joining Mark Labertz for a VSM learning journey. As it turns out, different folk have preferences towards subsystems and Marks was apparently the often forgotten system 3* star; it’s reflective capacity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I’ve not got a massively wide background on the VSM model - it would seem from experience that my favourite part of the system is the algadonic channels… (I love growing through life and stress, contract owners and licences, my heart bursts through my chest, I’m rescued!)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most attendees at the pub head to a restaurant together as I decide to head back to my hostel for a sleepless night considering the possibilities that Stephens presentation unlocked in my head regarding systematics…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-2&quot;&gt;DAY 2&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day I make it into the conference hall a little late missing the morning sessions… Damn, I missed Kelsies workshop on aligning DAOs to precidents in cybernetics… that would have been fun. I make it into Ivo Velitchkov’s presention on “viability of personal knowledge management systems” instead which is centred around the history of Zettlekasten and how to implement a viable ‘second brain’ style system. As an avid PKMs user I’m pretty familiar with  the history but the presentation reminds me to retune my interface and suggests I should expand my system with new lenses (currently I’m just using a basic triad as my filing structure but other geometries might also work well!)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up to bat is Peter Kawalek on “Designing data freedom: Stafford Beer’s work applied to civil rights and criminal justice” - which was rebranded to the more apt name of “security cybernetics”. Unexpectedly Peters presentation shed some light on what the operational arm of government (the cops and law enforcement) were actually dealing with in this day and age; oh my god - the poor bastards is all I can really say.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through his presentation it becomes increasingly clear that the variety of the criminal landscape is way beyond anything that our legal system is able to cope with. Due to this the algodonic channels are frigging screaming; not only are the cop tired but the whole legal system gets backed up with data vs data arguments, putting juries and judges to sleep.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this juncture I was uncertain what to pursue so stepped into Michael Wards PHD presentation “From reductionism to systems thinking: a complementary approach to emancipatory change” which pointed to a number of interesting leads and a key insight that emancipation is the reconciler of theory and practice. Sounds legit.
Mingling through a lunch break we come back into session for Czeslaw Mesjasz’s “Complex systems management and the traps of sustainability and corporate sustainability as polysemic notions” - which is admittedly a bit of a mouthful!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Czeslaw was an interesting chap though; extremely animated and unconcerned with his audience in the slightest while covering a lot of ground in a short space of time. His message was pretty simple; meaning is messy!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of Polysemics was also new and novel concept for me and essentially treats language as semiotic impulses that can be interpreted through many lens… my own preference being Bennetts qualitative geometries of course!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the Czeslaw assimilation came Benjamin Taylor - the gentleman that I’d discussed AI DAOs with earlier during the GPT workshop. He presented “The Viable System Model and Human System Dynamics through the lens of Barry Oshry’s Organic Systems Model” inclusive of some rather psychedelic history about the “Power lab” which was an experimental testing grounds for the examination of power dynamics - but starting with the metaphor of the blue dot!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blue dot symbolic points to roles and responsibilities and how they get distributed. He also covered some of the paradoxs organisations face when trying to evenly distribute their load; a story of how “stuff happens” and how pressure builds up in the system. The presentation included a number of ‘essential balances’ - prescriptive words and wisdom worth sharing:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viable systems balance the forces of love and power alongside the part and whole. Robust systems balance the forces of differentiation and homogenisation, with individuation and integration. This can be stacked  in a 2x2 matrix where:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Differentiation leads to increased adaptability = Power for the Whole&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuation leads to increased autonomy = Power for the Part&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homogenisation leads to stability = Love for the Whole&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support leads to Integration = Love for the Part&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Metaphorum&quot;src=&quot;bentaylor41.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides this 2x2 matrix there was some good advice on resolving some org pressures by “being a middle who maintains independence of thought and action”:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be the top when you can&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be the bottom when you should&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be a coach&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be a facilitator&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When they’re fighting, just stay out of it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Metaphorum&quot;src=&quot;bentaylor42.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point the day has ended - so as is Metaphorum tradition we retire to the bar for further conversation. This time I’ve bunked out a little early to spend time with Trevor and share my Pillar back story with him as he had a bloody hilarious encounter with Dave Siegel who turning up to Liverpool street and told a bunch of bankers that their offices would be empty in five years - yep, sounds like Dave’s style of controversy. Trevor was looking to hook David Atkins (from Holochain) up with him but upon conferral decided he might be a little difficult so sent him towards Art and Eric instead - the rest is history…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point in the middle of this story we end up discussing enneagrams and Trevor conveys a backstory about Idris Shah; the guy that took over Sherbourne House from Bennett before selling it… wow, lots of historical enrichment with the story of how Bennet met Gurdjieff and Opensky while working border control for the British government and was apparently the guy who granted them both visas.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grudjieff apparently found the UK a little oriental for his tastes and departed for Paris while Opensky stayed put. At the time of Openskys death his widow tells Bennet that Gurdjieff is still alive and in Paris, which was rather unsuspected for Bennett but apparently less so by Gurdjieff, who inherits and uses the proceeds of Openskys will towards repaying some relatively large debts he’d accrued - “what a bloody operator” Trevor chuckles!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point Marcus, a friend &#x2F; mentee of Trevors working on a startup for Island energy arrives as we continue into the discussion; bringing us to encounters with Stafford in the 90’s. At this point in time Staffords apparently uninterested in discussing the VSM but took special interested in the meaning of the enneagram or at least the page Shah left behind in his book that Trevor stumbled into. Faxing this page to Stafford certainly got his attention as he was over to the pub with Trevor the next day!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point Trevor kindly offers to take us both for a meal so we decide to leave the pub and continue the history lesson over Pizza. At this point we end up talking about other mutual acquaintances that pop their heads up in the crypto tech scene and then disappear and resurface due to controversy, contingency and gossip - it’s fun to compare perspectives from the sidelines; really weird stuff seems to happen. I’m gonna suggest that we go around binding time with words or writing narratives and then get caught in the mess, which subsequently needs to be snipped or unravelled in order to relieve the pressures - schism etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-3&quot;&gt;DAY 3&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last day is upon us and for me its another lateish rise again meaning I miss Mark and Kellys workshop but am just in time to receive the handout and notice the SoFI VSM diagram that looks like a kaballah with extra nodes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man all these high level consultants like Stafford and Bennet were frigging mystics I swear! Funny thing is I’ve seen this mandala before in the Regenerative Tech Community Discord as my friend Chris was sharing it; oh, haha small world - he’s been talking to Marc already and were just used as an example in the talk I just missed…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then have a presentation&#x2F;workshop on “Viability and Sustainable water management” in the Amazon to work through some of the issues of a real use case. I was hoping that this might inform an octadic mandala I’m working on with Atlantis DAO but the context was perhaps too desperate to compare across.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a short break were presented a video from a college that couldn’t make the event on “VSM application insights and questions from our VSM application research group”. Interestingly this opens up some opportunities to expand the models thinking by asking question like where does marketing fit? This is quite refreshing as it takes us out of silver bullet territory treating the model as a useful tool; thankfully many of the participants despite being well versed didn’t treat the model as a doctrine - which often happens with favourite reality models (I’m a sinner too!).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Waters, my friend from the pub was up next to share the architecture of the software he was working on with his presentation “Applying some cybernetic concepts to planetary viability – a skeleton on which to build.” The root ontology seemed to be based on the permaculture triple of “earth care, people care, fair share” and seemed like a pretty interesting project that had a number of similarities to other systems I’ve encountered; what I liked about John’s initiative was his pragmatic sense of imperative and building for now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Metaphorum&quot;src=&quot;nests7.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last up for the day was a fella called Gary Alexander with his presentation “A new common sense or VSM for all”. He shows a video he made with some others a couple of years back when he had no beard - “OH I remember you” I find myself blurting - “we met in 2018 at the Holochain London meetup”. This small world keeps getting smaller and he shows the activity he’s been up to at the local level with bringing the model to the community near him while reframing the language to be more accessible!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Metaphorum&quot;src=&quot;garyalexander1.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point we drop into open space mode and signal our interests sitting with each other to discuss pathways forward in a kind of offers and needs market. Beyond this the organising comittee and guests share a vision for Metaphorum 2 and the potential futures for realisation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After all this, things move into an AGM and I duck out to the pub with Trevor again before he catches his train and then return to hang with Ian again after the meeting. Boy oh boy has he had his work cut out but a bloody excellent job he’s done with the other organisers; a beautiful three days that has been hella informative - thank you dear organisers for an incredible event 🙏🙏🙏&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Poland: Chinwags Poznan</title>

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Castle&quot;src=&quot;castle.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realising that I’ve flown a bit out of my way I make my way towards the Chinwags gathering via train with the help and direction of a rather beautiful Polish lady that aids my ticket purchase towards Warsaw main and gets me on the right carriage. She’s just returned from a solo trip to Paris to visit the museums. After a hurried ticket purchase at the station and a frantic rush to the platform I make a train that will get me to my pickup about fifteen minutes late. Signalling this in the telegram and sharing my live location the group agrees to wait for me a little longer than planned. Blessed souls.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting on the bus I’m gracefully greeted by a number of faces I know from previous lives. Kris from my time at Giveth several years back, the lovely Vesta who I’ve bumped into numerous times at numerous gatherings, Laura and Nick from the 0x Salon who I met in Berlin and Owen who I met in November at LabsWeek and was thoroughly impressed by. The bus ride is calm and well composed for the sizeable group and I spend my time quietly talking with Vesta and Owen about travel, personal interests and music.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;travel-gallery gallery-2 gallery-resized&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Arrival&quot;src=&quot;arrival.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Castle&quot;src=&quot;landing.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Arriving in Poznan we draw up to an impressive castle and are shown to our rooms. The space is full of winding passages that seem to go up infinitely, until we reach an attic on the 7th or so floor; what a view! There are small rooms with couches all through the building, which is perfectly designed for unconferences and serendipitous wandering. There’s a little time for exploration before dinner and a plenary style convergence in the main hall.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken over the schedule we end with the terminal question of whether the sauna room should or should not be naked. This mole hill turns is unnecessarily made into a mountain and frustration builds through a consensus discussion that reaches no consensus. The meeting is adjourned for the evening and the group splinters into different parts of the castle to get to know each other more personally for a bit before bed. I joined the wholesome duo of Alex and another who were getting meta-philosophical outside before heading off to the clouds myself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning was lively; getting into the AI discussion with Remi to discuss Miladys, agroism and numerology; a conversation that started with my appreciation of his t-shirt which had a three eyed DMT kitten on it along with the phrase “I don’t care” written under it - a fun and funky style that resonates with my sense of aesthetic. Provided with a coffee from the kitchen we head outside to begin workshopping.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;travel-gallery gallery-2 gallery-resized&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Arrival&quot;src=&quot;outside1.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Castle&quot;src=&quot;outside4.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We are offered a number of topics to converse on and I join the table discussion on DAO representation. Everyone at the table promptly that agreed that voting was a stupid practice. Besides that very important consensus moment, the conversation fragmented a bit but some good riffs were shared on deliberative democracy, future governance, the nature of human assembly and “all under heaven” frameworks. A lot was said on dissent as well; the gems from our table are contained in the following pictures.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;travel-gallery gallery-3 gallery-resized&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Arrival&quot;src=&quot;sketch1.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Castle&quot;src=&quot;sketch3.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After this we had a fine plenary session where various groups presented followed by a session on how to build a service DAO for 20~ people. Sadly these fragments were not captured for the purposes of this report as we wrapped for a lunch of lively discussion. This was followed by a workshop by Other Internet, the folks working at Trust who I previously met at the 0x Salon. There was some dark alchemy at play with the handouts of fitting into framed ontological structures that I dissented from, though I later found out that this was an intentional provocation to get people thinking about human interactions over boxes and categories. Quite the bait and switch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here the workshop moved into a discussion on bridges, anchors and alliances based on a presentation before hand; if I recall the ontology correctly anchors were more institutional bodies that touch into more traditional regulated waters, with bridges as the link to alliances. I was pretty tired at this point though so I may be recalling things wrong; you’ll have to ask other internet about that. Here are some of the artefacts to make sense of yourself if you like!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;travel-gallery gallery-3 gallery-resized&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Castle&quot;src=&quot;otherinternet6.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; 
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Arrival&quot;src=&quot;circle.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last workshop before the day ended was a legal panel during which my memory grinds to a halt before booting up for the wholesome evening of stories and discussion around the campfire. In particular I remember enjoying Shannon’s recollections of the Ethereum scene over the last while as an organiser for ETH Denver and other events, after which I spent some time tying in with Oliver about Owens project “Vouch” &#x2F; “Wavelength” (same thing, different scopes) - essentially a reputation network.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most impressive original thinking of the week I can recall; bootstrapping off an in person identity solution he developed whereby one takes pictures to remember each other at a gathering to bootstrap a social graph. More impressive was he’d actually started building the project on Urbit and it had a working demo! Kudos homie, your doing better than most and your thinkings further ahead. What got me jazzed was that it was clean and simple enough to figure out where in the meta stack of ontologies it could actually fit; and I love it when plans comes together!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thoughts were that in a graph based network of nodes and edges we begin to assemble objective structures which we can hang subjective designs on; the semantic triple. In this case I found myself traversing the graph as such:
AD4M Communication protocol&#x2F;ontology of&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agents&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Languages&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perspectives&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triplicate the edge between languages and perspectives into the Trivium of:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logic&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhetoric&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grammar&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the grammar node we can expand to subjects, verbs, objects and then within the verbs category we can fit vouches&#x2F;warrants to create reputation markers a la Owens design. Yes, nice it fits!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I decide it’s time to give the sauna a go so head downstairs to see if I can figure it out. I turn it on and since there’s no one around I strip off for a shower that’s ummm interrupted by another guest. So much for avoiding controversy - they don’t seem particularly bothered and turn around to check the the dials. I’ve already sorted things out but it’ll be another 40m before the rooms hot enough to use, so in turn we head upstairs again to continue discussion for a bit before return; this time with a modesty towel!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day I’m down for breakfast a little late, manage to eat and then head outside for the workshop on AI meets blockchain by Vikram. Plenty of discussion and ideas about how it could be used for various ends - as well as discussion on the numerous pathways and constraints. I’m of the usual mind of when it comes to transparency - geometries, active inference and semantic ledgers. What’s left now is another evening of discussion and morning pack out to the airport!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addios and Ad Astra new friends! ✨&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having given Sogenji the boot and I snap some exotic lids and depart back to Tokyo to see my friend, arriving into the station at about 4pm absolutely starving, so grab some peanut brittle for the walk.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my sleep deprivation, I’m reasonably caffeinated though also unwashed since the last time we were together - so naturally I head for an Onsen upon hotel arrival. With five pools it was the most luxurious bath of my trip so I thoroughly soak my bones following a sequence of warm, hot, cold.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m panning out in the cold tub; between the lack of sleep, travel and caffeine the world is spinning to the point where I’m almost getting nauseous. Regardless I last around six minutes in these low temperatures and feel my dopamine baseline rising - I’m feeling lively again despite all the spin.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We head out to grab dinner, wander around and stumble into some karaoke for an authentic Tokyo experience. Finally we check out some gift shops for souvenirs and then happen into magic stone shop is literally a wizards wet dream; sounds of running water included…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After performing a coffee and writing ritual the next day, we say goodbye once again and part company. I take public transport over to the capsule hotel I stayed in at the start of my trip; mess about with sequence in the Onsen as usual and get some internetting done. Since I figure I’m somewhere in a ‘service’ modality of the time cycle I make the suggestion Regen install a bonding curve on their community pool. Beyond that I send my friend a card I was given during Pragma which might benefit a peer of his that was working on mangas.io when I met him years earlier…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday the zipper on my wallets coin pouch breaks so I spend the day touring skate&#x2F;surf shops looking for a replacement to no avail. However I do find a store with high quality goods that are reasonably priced so I pick up a pair of hard wearing baggies and a couple of fresh t-shirts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a weird day; a friend who’s writing a grant accuses me of treating him like GPT for not providing direct answers to his prompts which was particulary unsettling as I was contributing most of the artefacts… tangentially the other friend I messaged the night before with a card sends out an intro message saying that both myself and his friend are in the same city and should get a drink together. I ask where he is and drop a pin with my location; within a minuite synchronicity strikes and he responds saying he’s passing the capsule hotel!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I head downstairs to meet him and catch up; he’s not in great shape as a friend committed suicide that day. Fuuuuuck. That’s harsh - let’s get that drink man. He seems pleased to have some company as things are turbulent his side; he had also just had a fight with his co-conspirator earlier in the day as well. Something in the air man. Despite the state of affairs he’s in pretty reasonable spirits and given his love of Japan he seems pretty happy to become a tour guide to the area. We head for a drink in a lively hipster quarters nearby called Golden Gai and find room in a place called “open book”.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place is crammed but the other customers are friendly; the two couples in our immediate vicinity are both on honeymoon. We chat with them for a while and then spend some more intimate time catching up since it’s been about four years since we saw last each other. Upon departure we wish each other well and I head off in search of some food to pad my stomach; particularly those fried Edamame beans… so damn tasty!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday theres no longer room in the capsule hotel so I set off to find another place - the Uneo station hostel - which I’m absolutely delighted to find is about half the price; though of slightly worse quality. I have a call with Atkursh about his project and it’s governance before heading out to explore Uneo which is just fucking crazy at night. Gambling, sex shops, bizzares full of funky freaky fashion and drinking houses - this place has it all!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday is graceful; while following my feet around Uneo park (the one with Bronzor and Tyrunt lids) I discover and visit a beautiful flower garden. Pretty decent timing to play the “yes and” game as some Twitter friends are posting flower photos such. There’s a zen tower here that was ordered for destruction but thankfully a crafty general declared it as property of a non-rivalrous group in order to preserve the beautiful structure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I’m starved for concentration time and wanna clean up my loose ends so take a few days to scrape by twitter bookmarks into Obsidian for later reading and enrichment; a lots been happening in the world and its been impossible to keep up with all the entropy!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming increasingly aware that my time in Japan is limited and I’ll need to return home soon enough I do some cultural exploration beyond Pokemon and temples by heading into the Tokyo Museum which hosts many beautiful artefacts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I discover many beautiful stone Bhuddas, keen mechanical metal work, sparklingly sharp samouri swords from the endo period, elaborately precise prints of and pottery. Before my time at the museum is up I pay for a screening to learn of the artwork of a masterful monk who’s name escapes me…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine mentions that an Onsen out near the “Gundam wing guy was practically a spiritual experience” for him so I decide to spend my rather fragmented Friday retracting his steps. After some breakfast internetting I hop a train out to Koto city which feels like something straight out of Sonic the Hedgehog; namely because high speed train takes us around several islands inclusive of loop the loops, which is enlivening my inner child. I see where the game designers drew inspiration from.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving close the Gundam base and quickly find the giant mechanoid which is indicative that I’m on the right island; setting off to find the natural Onsen I was recommended. There’s only a couple of them near but responding to some photos I sent my friend he realises I’m on a wild goose chase. I head to the mall to check out the Gundam base and finally find a replacement for the wallet that broke; all good man - I enjoyed the exploration and the train ride alone was novel enough to make the trip worthwhile! Grabbing the same line home I delight in racing a bus on the motorway below!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional onsen is still on my mind the day after and so I do some online research to find a purifying bath which comes through volcanic rock. I choose Musashi-Koyama Onsen Shimizu-yu which has two natural pools; a black rock kuroyu thermal pool and a rich gold rotenburo pool - both containing many natural minerals to nourish the skin and soul.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Tokyo&quot;src=&quot;onsen.jpg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming in from these outdoor pools I take a wrong turn to open the door to a breaker room (electricity) before jump in to the indoor one and seat myself against its wall - ZAP!! “oh fuck, were in a pool of water with some dodgy mains on the other side… I better tell someone”. Running inside I ask someone to translate for me and am told it’s an install for the old people… phew. Cycling through through the different pools a number of times I leave both refreshed and exhausted!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday I go for a long walk to visit Sensō-ji temple; an ornate grounds built for the goddess of mercy thats surrounded by stone warrior demons. Clearly mercy from those rather vicious looking guys. The wishing shrine is covered in gold and has some incredibly beautiful black and gold doors. As with most temples, they are surrounded with merchants peddling the beautiful commerce so with my dwindling cash I purchase a chocolate pancake bun thing with what tastes like it has about 2% coca in it…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a few days left I continue with my cultural journey and head to the Nezu shrine which is famous for it’s hundreds of torii gates. Running through the gates to simulate a spiritual roller coaster I make sure to crack my head off a number of them - seems japan was built for people about a foot shorter than me. Stopping into a bakery on the way home on the recommendation of TimeOut, I grab a panda themed muffin to taste the skilled artisanship of Japanese bakers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday I just feel like walking and exploring a bit so I take a look around the Uneo temple and investigate the symbology. I head off towards the Tokyo dome in search of some closed botanical gardens…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason my feet take me all the way down to Chiyoda city which is a huge Island that’s home to the imperial palace. I don’t actually realise this exists until I pick up a semiotic trail that brings me past the palaces impressive, yet closed, gates. Sadly the moat and walls are faaar too big to climb as they had previously prepared for intruders like myself, several hundred years before my arrival!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exhausted from my touring I’m about ready to fly home again so spend my last day around Uneo in the hostel baths before flying through Shanghai for a night. This is followed by Italy for another layover and then finally arriving in Warsaw Poland for a few days of workshops at Chinwags - which is in a hella bougie castle…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodbye Japan!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ad astra ✨&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waking up in Kyoto I can tell I’m a bit fried from getting so buzzed while chasing Pokemon the day before. We get up, grab some coffee in Starbucks and do a bit of writing as has become interpersonal tradition; it’s gonna be a lazy grey Saturday.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After returning to the hotel to drop our bags, we set off for a walk and to find some vegetarian for lunch. This is harder than you’d think in Japan but we manage to find a decent restaurant serving a selection of tofu based meat substitutes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Kyoto&quot;src=&quot;food.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My companion is pretty tired and a little dissociated from her time in the monastery so try to entertain her a little and and keep a smile on her face. We stop for a drink a hipster joint that reminds me of Sunday after parties in clubland. Upbeat DJ vibes that are perfect for an hours chill out session.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We head back to the hotel for a rest and I head up to experiment with the Onsen once again. I’m absolutely panning out in the cold bath but doing pretty well to last six minutes between saunas. My companion is exhausted and needs rest so I leave her to recuperate while heading out to capture the wild Pokemon of Kyoto!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bit of a drizzly walk and waaay longer than expected but I catch my first Kyoto Pokemon while picking up a number of lids specific to the area (call them gym badges maybe?). By the time I return the days pretty much over so we chill out and watch Rick and Morty for the evening.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;lids&quot;src=&quot;lid3.jpg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday we start the day with our coffee and writing ritual before heading off to the Eastern outskirts to collect a two more Pokemon on my list - as well as visit some other less important cultural relics like the temples ;)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First stop was Yasaka-jinja Shrine; a shinto park hosting an Igglybuff, Cleffa and Pichu beside its beautiful Koi pond. Aiding an air of authenticity to the shrine experience were numerous Japanese women touring the place in Kimonos; hmmm, original cosplay!?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sights seen and creatures captured we get moving towards the next spot and encounter the Chion-in temple along our route and for exercise we decide to climb the giant steps and explore. The scale is impressive; like where did they even find trees for these huge structures? Everything about the construction is enormous - just check out the giant bell!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We depart to Okazaki Park in order to collect my last real life NFT of the day while coincidentally encountering two Doge along the way - I get why these beautiful animals became a meme coin to be fair… Needing a dopamine top-up we grab some free mochi samples from a sweet shop and promptly capture a Cyndaquil and Darmanitan lid before ambling into the Heian-jingu Shrine. there are some pretty cool dragons that my Poke hunting apprentice does a decent job of imitating! (no consent to post unfortunately :p)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Temporarily finished Poke hunting at temples; we set course for the National Gardens surrounding the (closed) Imperial Palace. As we arrive universe promptly signals no with loud alarm and a booming thunder clap immediately preceding a hail storm… I’m soaked so we make a beeline for a drink in search of some shelter, ending up a Japanese gin distillery called “House of KI NO BI”. Pokemon in bag and kilometres under belt we head back to the hotel for a bath and bed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Kyoto&quot;src=&quot;gates.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning we perform our internetting rituals and head out Poke hunting once again; this time to the West of Kyoto. Having itched for some traditional tea the day before we keep our eyes peeled for a place to sample such and find a spot on the long walk over towards the Nishikyogoku Athletic Park; a real poke gym for once where we capture a wild Chikorita and Shiftry!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Kyoto&quot;src=&quot;chickorita.jpg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realising exactly how far our next stop is on foot we grab a cab up to Arashiyama - or more specifically the Togetsukyo Bridge. Getting out of the cab we hastily head to the Nakanoshima Area to find Kyotos last Pokemon; a beautiful flying Ho-oh.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Ho-oh&quot;src=&quot;ho-oh.jpg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;travel-gallery gallery-3 gallery-resized&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;bridge&quot;src=&quot;bridge6.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;At this point I promptly declare myself the ‘greatest trainer of them all’ as I’ve collected all the Pokemon I will find on this visit to Japan. There’s a monkey sanctuary nearby so we decide to head up the hill to get in trouble by throwing Pokeballs at them. It’s a long climb but a beautiful walk that answers many of yesterdays question of “where the bloody hell did the get the timber for these temples” - clearly on these hills which are full of beautifully straight trees of nearly uniform proportions… crazy nature actually grows like this!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;travel-gallery gallery-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;hill&quot;src=&quot;hill1.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;hill&quot;src=&quot;hill3.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We find plenty of monkeys at the top of the hill and are just in time for a show. No they don’t perform - but they do steal tourist equipment and already have a fellas lens. One of the keepers is chasing the cheeky blighter down and the whole troop are in on the action screeching something akin to “invader, invader, enemy of the state!”. Against the odds the keeper catches the kleptomaniac culprits and the equipment returned to the owner; what a show!!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After viewing the whole of Kyoto from the hilltop we descend from the summit and towards the bamboo forrest. On route we stumble into Hōgon-in Temple which is exceptionally serene but it’s getting late so they’re closing. Entering the forrest the exaggerated growth of the shoots remind me of the fight scene in the movie Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon - a stereotype I’m sure that arises for many other tourists also. They’re kinda haunting I must admit; the cool temperatures and darkening light also gives off blare witchy vibes. Guess I’m in movie mode now…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pass by a sweet store to pick up some presents and grab public transport back towards where we are staying, passing by a karaoke centre for some shits and giggles…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Kyoto&quot;src=&quot;station.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning (17th April) we say goodbye and board trains in opposite directions; I’m headed to Sogenji with the aim of a midday arrival and my companion to Tokyo. After a minor liquidity crunch with crypto currencies I manage to make it to the temple at precisely five minutes past midday; so roughly on time!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;soghingi&quot;src=&quot;soghingi1.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;travel-gallery gallery-3 gallery-resized&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;sogenji&quot;src=&quot;sogenji4.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The temple is quiet to the point that it seems as if there’s nobody around. Checking around the place I find the kitchen and signal my arrival. They inform my liaison who’s preoccupied but on his way so I offer a hand with the cooking. Chefs a decent dude and up for a bit of a laugh as we go about our preparation work during which my liaison arrives. He carries an impersonal vibe that’s pretty dismissive without having actually interacted on anything.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Kyoto&quot;src=&quot;dressed.jpg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m briefly shown some of the immediately relevant spaces, like where I’m sleeping, where to put my bag and given a handout and handbook on Zazen explaining the practice:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GUIDES:
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Welcome Guide&quot;src=&quot;WelcomeGuide.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Handbook&quot;src=&quot;SogenjiHandbook.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is pretty good reading from first glances and we briefly discuss some of the principals, with concentration being the core axiom that supposedly sums it all up. I mention that this is one of seven principals in my own “fourth way” practice and am essentially dismissed; oh dear, I was hoping for some enrichment but it seems my liaison is tightly coupled to the orthodoxy. My ‘psychic intuition’ had already picked up on the places energetics and was screaming to get the hell out of here - and this interaction might have justbeen the exit sign. Damn, I only just got here, I internally rationalise, I’ll wait a little longer and see…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My liason departs and there’s some free time to check out the forest and grounds of the monastery which provide a breathtaking exploration, before we are to return for the elaborate ritual of dinner. Much formality - to my tastes this feels plain rigid with grip seems to prioritise the principal of order… which I’m personally partial to but not to this degree!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After eating we head down to the sitting hall to do a whole lotta breathing; a process that’s also pretty formalised. Everyone starts in place and with newbies like myself placed in the outer circle. For new entrants like me we are asked to perform a ritual of walking over to the inner camber and bowing before to the inner sanctum before walking its length to again bow to the monk holding space before returning to their seat. Ok, cool by me sure!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bell rings in the distance and the “in group” of monks head off to sit in the Roshis quarters. Once they are all gone a bell rings to signal the beginning of Zazen, during which one is not supposed to change their posture until the ring of the next bell.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very quickly I learn of my ergonomic imbalances which become bloody painful to hold through. Since I’m not adjusting my posture until the next bell I figure I’ll breathe into these spots quite deeply and after a significant amount of what’s essentially holotropic breathing, I feel my hands cramping. Just before the bell rings I’m asked by another new recruit to quieten down - which is 100% my intent - once the bell rings and we’re allowed to readjust posture!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the next round I’ve got a handle on my ergonomics and the rest of the session flows much more easily with minimal distractions. After three or four rounds we get up for Kinhin (rapid walking meditation) and then back to more sitting. Slowly the monks who left earlier to sit with the Roshi return one by one and continue with more sitting. The first monk to return sits directly opposite my line of sight and we proceed to look through each other for the next several hours.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point in the session the monk holding space begins to wander around with a stick offering people beatings on the shoulders to wake them up. As I can sense that I’m leaving soon I wish to experience as much authentic zazen before departure so I bow to them and take two whacks on each shoulder. Yes, that’s a little bit of a system shake up and quite pleasant really. After about several hours of mindless breathing we finish sitting, putting cushions away and pulling down beds where applicable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before crashing out I read some of Aurobindo’s writing and converse briefly with my liaison who’s interested to know if there are “enlightened beings in Auroville?”. Having been quite dismissive of my opinions earlier I respond indirectly by asking “whats an enlightened being?”. He responds with a humble admission of ignorance and which in typical zen style sounds both authentic and scripted. I play along by suggesting that I don’t know either, adding that I may have met one or two of them while there. We finish our tea and go to bed where I sleep lightly, while dreaming heavily.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We awake at 3am quickly file out to another building, passing through light rain and move into a chanting session about the Buddah in a language that’s essentially unknown to me. I get lost in this text but quietly vocalise in the same monotonous tone so as to activate my vocal chords for the day without disrupting the rest of the group. We then put our cushions back and quickly file out to another room to do more prayer and then return to do some quiet reading; this time the text is in English and quite absorbing. From here we depart for the breakfast ritual.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m then asked to sign the guest book inclusive of arrival and departure dates. I decide this is a good time to signal my departure so inform the monk that this place is not my jam and head off to let my liaison know I’m off after chores. He looks overjoyed at this and says I can just leave. I head down to the sitting room to help with cleaning, say my goodbyes over a cup of tea and then get the hell outta dodge!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my senses it felt like the place was in decline and that energetics were getting appropriated from strangers like myself to sustain the inner membrane - who knows though. It seemed that there were some good people there but the place didn’t vibe; if enlightenment is liberation then subservience to an orthodoxy felt pretty paradoxical to me. Fine material but a heavy dose of concentration didn’t feel like it was on my agenda; at least not without an aligned purpose. I head to Starbucks, sort out my liquidity crunch and head to Tokyo for a final evening with my companion before her departure the next day. Once again I’m on my own, destination unknown…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ad astra!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Tokyo Energy&quot;src=&quot;ultrasupernew.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flying from Vietnam to Tokyo, I dig into several of the books I’ve procured from Auroville by Sri Aurobindo. One of these is called “The Experience of The Psychic Being and its Growth” which seems to describe some of my more recent experiences related to enhanced synchronicity as well as some symptoms that I’ve not personally experienced… in particular the gold ‘bursting’ effect that clusters eight parametric qualities seems new, though I do seem to have touched upon the realm of golden pentads around January this year. That was freaky.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esoteric experiences aside, I’m totally winging it on my travels listening to what Sri would call ‘psychic intuition’ so have absolutely nothing booked upon landing. Once on the ground, I grab a coffee and see what’s available online; unfortunately most places are pretty expensive though it seems a capsule hotel in Shinjuku is on discount for the night so I book it and jump a train over from the airport taking me past the Japanese country side. The landscape is incredibly neat and tidy; somehow reminding me of a less wild version Ireland!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Tokyo Energy&quot;src=&quot;fields.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My capsule hotel is incredibly novel as it’s basically an “Onsen”, meaning that its modelled around a public bath and sauna. These baths are actually pretty common in Japan but I’m blown away by how lavish the hospitality is given they provide all sorts of free grooming products, sports drinks and rice bowls with miso soup. Talk about a drifters wet dream! 😂&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before stripping off and hopping into the pool off I double check with the attendant that this is indeed expected behaviour; he says yeah so I get naked, have a wash and start developing an ‘Onsen Protocol’ for myself by experimenting with heating sequences. The order of hot sauna followed by cold shower and warm pool leaves me with a sense of rather flaky expansiveness; relaxed and rather doolally from the jetlag I take a look around Shinjuku in search of a SIM card and some dinner; night time outside is frigging wild and incredibly high stimulus!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Tokyo Night&quot;src=&quot;tokyonight.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awakening from my capsule casket the next day, I head down to the Onsen once again to try a new protocol; this time experimenting with a pattern of cold, warm, then hot which leaves me feeling rather social. I grab a coffee and then head off to shake out the caffeine by taking a walk down to Shibuya city.
Spotting the decorative manhole covers I remember that there is a tourist tradition of ‘drain spotting’ as the Japanese water companies intentionally highlight their manhole covers so that the locals are aware of where their tax money goes. Due to my personal interest in semiotics; I begin to run around the city enthusiastically photographing the floor like a stupid Gaijin!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I’m booked to go to Pragma Tokyo the next day I decide it best to try sort out my shoes situation to avoid looking like a complete rag and bones man. There’s an interesting paradox I’ve noticed over the years that seems to relate to the Matthews effect; essentially those working their asses off tend to look so haggard and unappealing that they are passed over for opportunities, while the groomed and vital tend often to be the beneficiaries of opportunity. Since I’m intending to attract capital for a semantics project I make the effort doll myself up to avoid falling prey to such biases. Man we are suuuch irrational beings!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Tokyo Night&quot;src=&quot;shoes.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waking up early the next day I make sure to set myself up for success with another Onsen in the morning, coffee in the station and a decent half hour walk towards the venue. In all honesty; it’s easier to find other lost bodies en route than the event itself and a group of about seven of us pile up before we find the exact location in a rooftop conference centre.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon entry to Pragma Tokyo we are provided with chopsticks and a notebook after which we proceed to the morning networking where I happen across an interesting spectacle between two gents who are politely wrestling with each other for conversation control.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually I’ve met one of them already - he’s from Protocol labs - though his rather eccentric interlocutor is mysterious to me. I throw in some cheeky challenges for the sake of status signalling and we’re into a relatively civilised game of triadic tennis. As the eccentric interlocutor departs, he offers his card and says goodbye; a science and technology guy hmmm - that’s pretty resonant!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stick around a little while longer to check in with the representative from Protocol Labs and then leave to talk to a few others in the crowd. As the Ethereum Foundation takes the stage on the subject of culture, I settle into a couch next to a really lovely guy called Nao - who was until recently leading up Coinbase Japan. He’s a total gem; open, curious and friendly - so we discuss culture building and exchange resources on the topic (like emergent cyclical theory).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I depart from the couch to grab a cup of tea I recognise a passing Juan Bennet from Protocol labs. Attempting to say hello he signals that he’s getting ready to go onstage so I flash him an ok sign and resign to let him be. Pretty shortly after that he takes the stage to discuss technology trends, ecosystem building blocks and entrepreneurship in general. During the questions segment of the talk I relate to Douglas Englebart’s work on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dougengelbart.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;view&#x2F;138&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Augmenting Human Intellect&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and ask him “given PL’s mission statement to benefit humanity; what what kind of capabilities would you most like to see augmented”. He’s big on DataDAOs and Compute Over Data; which I reframe in my head as ‘Semantic Ledgers’.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Tokyo Night&quot;src=&quot;pragma.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guy who asked a question before me related to methodology development seems like an ally; so I grab a seat next to him and briefly chat before heading over to say hi to Juan (who’s already getting hounded by a total bro dude man). I let Carlos my ally jump in ahead of me and hang back to create some space for them to talk while also enabling a clear exit path. After a few minuites of conversation Juan gracefully says he’d like to take a few more questions and warmly engages me on the subject of Xerox Parc and project Xanadu.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a short lunch break Stani from Aavve companies takes the stage to talk about and promote lens protocol; a web3 social network. I’ve seen a number of people pointing to their lens profile but am generally unfamiliar with the project. I appreciate the way he’s leaning into the positive potentiality rather than getting caught in problem thinking so feel inclined to eventually learn more so I ask him about digital identity during the questions round. Given his response I offer to share some design and end up jamming with him near the VIP section; this feels incredibly humble and receptive for a guy that’s just come off stage. I like Stani.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Pragma&quot;src=&quot;pragma2.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s some blabber blabber lightning presentations after this about defi stuff; during which I hang out with a pretty chillers old fella from a manga company who’s working on a NFT story called ‘laid back llama’ before Balaji teleports onto the big screen via Zoom.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Tokyo Night&quot;src=&quot;balaji.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man this guy is smart and incredibly driven to get shit moving due to his rather unsettling perspective of the macro economic situation which he does a good job to present eloquently. He asserts that he’s not a doomer but is also thoroughly bell ringing about what he calls an omni-crisis. I’m a little torn about this because while he is justifying his position with facts I lack the macro economic experience to discern if whats evident to him seems likely. Still, he’s damn smart and it was great to pick up that transmission!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;My new friend Nao has been cool enough to share another event with me and heads over during Balajis talk. He’s gonna see if he can leverage his clout to get me in and suggests I hang back until he knows for sure. He fails at the hero pass though I’m certainly grateful for the efforts. I hang around for the networking and meet a number of really great contacts that are all smart, interesting and resourceful. In particular I make friends with a guy called Cole thats interested in building on lens protocol the day after at the hackathon so I jam with him on some identity primitives and wish him good luck.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Tokyo Night&quot;src=&quot;rooftop2.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I leave the building I see trees and decide to take an unusual exit - bumping into Cole once again. We wander around the rooftop garden and guesstimate a route out of the building only to encounter a Super Mario statue that leads us in to a Nintendo store. Oh hellll, this is a curios spot; the whole place is themed stores - Nintendo, Pokemon, Street Fighter, One Piece, Hello Kitty and a bunch of others; quite the cornucopia of novelty in here!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally making it out of the commercial novelty trap, I decide to wander home through Shinjaku park passing the many beautiful flowers hit the Onsen once again upon arrival. Mmmm miso rice for dinner and a wander round the famous crossings!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Tokyo Night&quot;src=&quot;shinjakupark1.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Tokyo Night&quot;src=&quot;shinjakupark2.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next destination is Sogengi temple to try out Zazen meditation in a legitimate Zen monastery but that’s not for another few days; I’m due to meet Alex upon her departure which seems to be happening slightly early. I’ve one thing to do in Tokyo before I meet her though… catch all the local Pokemon. Yes. Pokemon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enthralled with drain spotting as my tourist activity of choice I have discovered there are a number of Pokemon lids around Japan and right here in Tokyo city there are precisely eight of them to catch! These are distributed across two areas of the city; six in Machida and two in Ueno. Machida park has the greatest concentration of them as apparently their progenitor lived nearby, so I decide this will be my first stop. After this I’ll go to Ueno get the last two before heading back to the hostel to pick up my bags and then down to meet Alex in the evening.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div align = &quot;centre&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;embed&#x2F;O94h8PofQT4&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;&#x2F;iframe&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the rare Pokelids I seek within the park, Machida is a new area - so I’m delighted to find some new covers designs of the off brand variety on my way to the entrance. Man this place is so beautiful the pictures compose themselves - which is lucky because I’m not much of a photographer!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Machida Park&quot;src=&quot;machidapark.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;lid&quot;src=&quot;machidalids1.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;travel-gallery gallery-2&quot;&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I follow my intuition and quickly stumble into a Pollywag! I toss my Pokeball and capture the tadpole instantly, after counting to three for my flash to go off its sealed away into my gallery. I’m now officially a Pokemon trainer but this thing will be useless in a fight. I move onwards towards open ground where I find an number of cool off brand lids; a squirrel with an umbrella and two kingfishers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Pollywag&quot;src=&quot;pollywag.jpg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;travel-gallery gallery-2&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Squirrel&quot;src=&quot;squirrel.jpg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theres a giant water statue nearby which looks like prime pokeland but alas construction workers have taped it off. However the Japanese are easily the most polite and helpful culture I’ve ever encountered; a worker spots me looking for something and asks if I need help. I tell him I’m poke hunting and he escorts me to the gym!! Domo origato, this gent has just helped me capture a Squirtle, Rattata, Pidgeot and Picachu across two lids. Around the corner I find an Oddish, Catterpi and Weedle; this games already far more fun than I’d expected and I feel like a total winner for capturing so many critters so easily; only two left in this park!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I set off again following my feet and am brought over a hill and past some streams. As the path rambles on I happen across the Machida City Museum of Graphic Arts and decide to pop in. The free exhibit is full of old school prints made from wood blocks; which is an aesthetic that I’ve always had resonance with. It’s bloody gorgeous.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Leaving the museum I attempt to buy all the post cards in hopes of training an image generator with them but they don’t take electronic payment, which sends me on a banking mission. After a modicum of difficulty but ultimate success over the bank machines I return to pay the cashier and take away a number of ‘choice tokens’.
Back to my poke hunt, there’s two more critters to find but and get distracted by a swing (with ‘eat the elephant’ lyrics in my head). Coming down from the hilltop I’m once again reflecting how bloody beautiful this park is. The pools and gardens are breath taking; full of winding paths that have wuwei written all over them. The composition is unparalleled. At the far end of the park I capture my Bulbasaur and Charmander lids!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All things considered, it’s getting pretty late in the day. I’ve been enjoying the park thoroughly but it’s time to get to the other side of town or I’ll not make it down to Kyoto later. I head for the train and trip it over to Ueno about an 45m away. I’m pretty charged from my days activity and realise I need to add an hour in order to make it back to the hostel so I blast it round the park as quick as I can, while also snapping new lids and sight seeing at 2x speed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theres a shinto shrine in the middle of a large reed filled lake that takes me off course a while before I reorient myself and proceed with the poke mission. Up the stairs past another temple, ever vigilant I ensure not to miss any new lids nor the beautiful cherry blossoms, I make it to the Tokyo Museum to capture Baltoy, Bronzor, Wynaut and Tyrunt. That’s it; I friggin’ caught ’em all in one day!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the hostel to pick up my bags and grab the train down to Kyoto. After some minor cashflow issues, a couple hours train ride and a reasonable walk to the hotel with my heavy bags, I arrive just before the clock strikes twelve. Having earn’t my gym badges; I’m ready for a good nights rest and make contact with embracing company!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;This is an image&quot;src=&quot;light.jpg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Settled and stable once again in a reasonably priced hotel; I decide to head out for coffee in the international zone and see what trails there are to follow. Not wishing to miss the experience of transcending in the Matrimandir I set course towards the giant golden egg in hopes of finding a means to book such a visit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I begin by exploring the visitors centre and learn that Auroville was not built for it’s initial settlers but instead to inspire later generations of visitors. As I depart I stumble into a systematic cluster of parameters that are apparently the mothers symbol; a dodecad of archetypal qualities to flowers - woah!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;The mothers&amp;#x27; Symbol&quot;src=&quot;MothersSymbolCropped.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the trail further there are a number of tokens clearly left behind for adept scavengers like myself. I’m delighted to find this work as it ties into the material that I’ve been studying at h3uni.org and consequentially wonder if Aurobindo and Gurdjieff migh have ever crossed paths?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Perseverence&quot;src=&quot;12perseverence.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Continuing along the path I collect all twelve of the tokens above en route towards the giant cosmic egg. Just before my arrival at the viewing spot, I pause a moment to enjoy the sprawling Banyan tree; it’s gigantic and seems to have several other trees grafted into its extensive branches for both support and nourishment. I have to send Jimi this beauty so snap a picture!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Banyan&quot;src=&quot;banyan2.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking out over the gardens from the viewing spot it dawns on me that Auroville is far from complete; even the gardens around matrimandir are still under construction as they are apparently still putting in the water works.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flashback of my time at Liminal Village in Italy arises where I helped Roberto with a grey water pool, though this is on another scale altogether! Sandro would have loved the diggers here for sure; he always had a hard-on for the big toys and these were a level up on the ones he was driving!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;View of the Egg&quot;src=&quot;view.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Water Works&quot;src=&quot;pool.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set off back down the road again with no idea where I’m headed, hedging along the outer perimeter before hitting the gate house. Maybe I can book a meditation here? I check in with the guards who say no and are utterly unhelpful about how to book so I message Laurence to find out how he managed to do so before continuing my hunt for the next serendipitous token.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmmm, I’ve been walking for a while and haven’t found much yet. I’m enjoying my jaunt but finding only a few curiosities despite the amusing street signs; I decide to visit Humbleness avenue before venturing into Prosperity as this seems like an appropriate order to proceed as one certainly doesn’t wanna do it the other way around… Besides some pretty flowers there’s are not many interesting curiosities so decide to trek back towards my initial point of departure at the visitors centre.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This leads me past by some rather aggressive dogs that come after my heels and need to be scared off by threatening them with a coconut while barking and growling back; they run when chased which I internalise as a life lesson.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En route back there are numerous colourful temples with pantheons of rainbow gods as well as some smouldering grey ones that look like portals to the underworld. Some beautiful mandalas round these parts too; Rangoli’s as tribute to Lakshmi (or as Rishi put it NFT’s to god)!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Temple of doom&quot;src=&quot;temple.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at visitors centers I decide to plunder the information boards for hidden parameter clusters; the Aurovillians have done a good job with their systematic groupings - bravo you beauties - you’ve been preserving your esoteric transmission exceptionally well; though I’m still not sure exactly sure the magickal roots this place, it’s pretty enigmatic and the lineage feels legit! (Max Théon apparently).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checking Twitter out that evening I notice Joe Brewer’s emitted some warning signals related to the Regen Foundation after having been messed around and instrumentalised by them. Feeling a degree of accountability towards that unfolding I ask him if he minds sharing some of the details and after some initial reflection on these I recall the letter that arrived from chaosmos the day before within Jashs gift and decide it’s time to sink the boat by publicly sharing my own experience and testimony on Twitter - aye - what a dramatic universe!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expecting a bunch of vitriol in response I decide to turn off my phone and start Friday with some legitimate Vedic healing, which did not disappoint. The shaman had a collection of wooden chisels that he used to affect 144 points in the feet which I note as an interesting multiple of twelve… empirically speaking my energetics were notably effected from this therapy and I became unusually chatty for my pre-caffeinated state. I learnt the shaman made all his own medicine as well though I didn’t try them due to the relatively high cost.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feet in good shape (for once), I set off for morning coffee and to check the activity board. It really didn’t seem like there was much on bar some “power yoga” a couple of hours later so I decided to kill some time by walking out to the movement centre in order to give that a go. As it was my friends birthday a few days prior, I’d been trying to call through to wish him well and finally got through on the walk. He’d recently become a father and seemed pretty happy to be white picket fencing with his beautiful and caring wife Maddie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power yoga session certainly lived up to its name; starting slowly but quickly picking up pace to become exceptionally challenging (for me at least). The instructor noticed my struggles and reaffirmed the invitation to retreat into child pose whenever we felt necessary, which is something I was already doing whenever things got too tough for me. This is something that a friend experienced in Samkyha mentioned as a stumbling block on his journey so was only too happy to surrender when past my capacity. I thanked the instructor for a fantastic stretch and set out on my way; I felt a liveliness in my feet and my general ergonomics from the legs to chest were feeling pretty damn good at this point!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday I decide to entertain myself with some of challenges Laurence had implicitly set me up with earlier in the week; “Transcend in the Matramandir”, “grab some cookies from the Auroville bakery; choconut”, “Tantos has excellent food” etc. - and since Jash wanted to head in the rough direction got in the car with him and ticked the latter challenges off the list and sent back the evidence.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;text messages&quot;src=&quot;thegame.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jash is headed back to the hotel so drops me near the Svram research centre for musical instruments where I test out everything in store and then join a tour in the sound garden. The tour introduction has already started and as I’m paying for my ticket the larger than life host asks some rather metaphysical questions that I respond to with a cosmological quip that he enjoys (I can’t remember what).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;embed&#x2F;videoseries?si=s_Wb0FZe4rfNtf7v&amp;amp;list=PL-sU4FCUDRCe7NKZU2ZOuCvlRQ8k1VAT-&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;&#x2F;iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here we break into groups with different guides and tour the garden; my guide seems quite the miser who’s just stating surface level information so I break off and investigate the toys on my own. This somewhat pisses him off as he gets rather upset once I happen upon the cymatic plates; he accuses me of disrespecting the instrument and ignorance of it, to which I demonstrate considerable knowledge otherwise and he kinda changes his tone. At this point I’ve played with the various instruments anyway so decide to leave the garden based on his unplayful vibe.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;embed&#x2F;videoseries?si=GZYpUh-KHHlYqU6n&amp;amp;list=PL-sU4FCUDRCdZ1zTQcVQCe-dwSi2PCyJW&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;&#x2F;iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I’ve also been mistakenly charged 10x the tours ticket price I return to the music store to get a refund and as I’m leaving bump into the host who actually turns out to be the store owner. He begins to engage me with Aurovillian metaphysical philosophy and we end up in a bit of a satsang together around the spiritualisation of matter and such. He’s delightfully entertaining and seems to be sharing some pretty advanced teachings and intuitions. Somewhere in the passing hours he informs me that I was brought to Auroville for a reason which seems both true and a truism!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the sun begins to set I head back to the hotel to find Rishi and Jash in a design jam. They suggest a gig in the same area where I started the day and since Laurence already challenged me to grab a cheesecake in Aurojar cafe after recieving my previous messages the proposition appeals.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I depart on foot to close out the loose end and send through both a proof and a request for less hedonistic challenges. He asks me if I ticked off the matrimandir, which I’ve booked for the final day before departure and awake at 7:30am for such a privilege.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;text messages&quot;src=&quot;thegame2.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving to the visitors centre there’s a queue to the auditorium where one is informed of Aurovilles history and symbology. We then jump into a bus to the cosmic egg and are permitted entry into the gardens once we’ve turned in our phones and electronic devices. From here we are led into the Matrimandir in a ritualistic fashion, replacing shoes with white socks and then following a spiral catwalk from the ground floor to the meditation chamber.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Matrimandir&quot;src=&quot;matrimandir.jpg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In here, a beam of light enters through a hole in the roof channelling the sun into the largest contact ball I’ve ever seen; at 70cm its apparently the largest perfect glass sphere in the world… This is supposedly symbolic of concentration in that it focuses the light downward into the marble lilly pond several floors below. Holding it’s weight are several hexads stuck together that are supposedly Aurobindos symbol, though more widely known as Solomons seal or the star of David.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chamber has round walls so it’s an (intentional?) acoustics nightmare; every tiny sound carries and coughs reverberate loudly! There is little to no silence in the room; despite it being mandated. I wonder if this is all an elaborate joke referencing our inability for stillness?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After leaving the inner sanctum we are left to investigate the grounds and invited to meditate in one of the twelve energy centres of our own choosing (based on the mothers symbol above). These little enclaves were kinda cool with their coloured lighting and funky shapes on the wall; nothing too special but would make cool saunas - which is what the one I visited was due to lack of air conditioning!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marble lilly pond below was also kinda cool, though I honestly got culty swimming pool vibes from the whole place. It’s a decent spectacle but frankly it felt pretty plastic and material - which they are assumedly trying to spiritualise! I found it all to be quite interesting magick none the less; especially the geometric symbols at each entrance. What’s the messaging here? And what’s the meaning?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The platonic solids in tetradic petals huh…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having started the tour inside the centre of the cosmic egg, we are freed to check out the truly beautiful gardens. Similar to the mothers symbol there are twelve petals around the egg that each representing a different cosmic quality. Only four of the twelve gardens were complete; though several others were under construction. Here’s a photo from the Auroville website.
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;Symbology&quot;src=&quot;ParkOfUnityPetals.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Departure&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finishing up here I return to the hotel to say goodbye to Rishi and Jash before hopping into a cab to the airport. It turns out my first flight is delayed, which scuppers my exit. I’m told that I can get a refund for this and grab an alternative ticket to Mumbai for $30~ which I take.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checking in for a flight to Vietnam I’m asked if for a covid test; whoops, nope forgot about that… Vaccination, nope. “Where can I get one?”. “Outside” says the checkin agent and takes me towards the exit. She asks the security where it is and they say its closed down. Crap. I decide to google an answer and make a dash for it given my limited time. The first recommendation is non existent so I google an alternative and try jumping in a cab. The driver points out that there is a test centre just over by the entrance and there actually is… aye, thank god for this guy!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask for two tests the immediate one and the one 48 hour test I need to give the check-in desk for Vietnam. The lady here is cool with that but doesn’t have a card reader, she let’s me take the tests before running inside with all my bags in search of an ATM. Literally all the ATM’s in the airport however are outta cash or not working so I ask an American tourist if he’d be able to help me out.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He kindly agrees and I give him the spare change I have for his larger denomination bill before bringing it back to the PCR lady only to find out I’ve given him too much change! Since I’m only a little short however she agrees to let it slide.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exhausted from running around with my bags and several kilos of books I finally make it to the check-in desk to and the celebratory fanfare of agents who didn’t think I was gonna make it. They give me extra leg room seats and I head to boarding.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💎 Good bye India, you’re a precious jewel! 💎&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we depart here’s a selection of Rangoli and other tokens found on my Easter egg hunt around Auroville that don’t quite fit anywhere else!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;This is an image&quot;src=&quot;art.jpg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday we say good bye to the folks round Atlantis HQ and after some lunch we set off for Auroville with the unexpected addition of Treegens Jimi, adding some welcome dynamism to the party of myself and Rishi.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;This is an image&quot;src=&quot;motorway.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stopping at various points en route to enable Jimi to host various twitter spaces we exchange tunes and banter while beelining our way towards a hotel just outside Auroville. Were trying to make a 9pm zoom slot that requires a computer and due to a fucked laptop screen hes hoping for a place with a TV.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty tight but we make it; no spare screen though so I give him my computer for the call and enjoy his radiant energy and love for treeeeeees from two floors up; I’m frankly laughing my ass off as I consider the porters perspective of this spectacle because Jimi’s in the lobby positioned about 2 ft from the front desk and emphatically onboarding folks for an attempt at the Guinness world record. This would probably be a bit annoying if it were for some less quirky cause but since it’s for most trees planted in a day it’s probably quite resonant with the Aurovillian ethos!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;This is an image&quot;src=&quot;entry.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
Entering the international zone&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning we pack up our stuff and head for coffee in the visitors centre thates only a few minuites walk away the international zone. As I’m checking out the information boards Rishi signals my attention to say that he belives he just spotted a rather mysterious acquaintance of ours called Manoj; a mystic that once graced an equinox gathering we organised in 2020!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if to confirm the intuition, my phone unexpectedly started playing some Gurdjieff DeHartmann tunes and we make haste to say hello to our suspect. Indeed it is Manoj; he’s moving extremely slowly as if carrying a lot of mental weight. As we depart from the interaction I let the friend who introduced us know - who it turns out had just been on an ayahuasca journey the night before and had synchronistically seen Manoj (or someone that looked like him) within his visions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;This is an image&quot;src=&quot;lobby.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we depart, Jimi books us all places at the “BonGipsy eco-hut stay” a hippie haunt that costs about a fiver each. On first appearances its a pretty interesting environment but something’s up; I feel a heeeeeavy drag of tamas energy. Damn; this place is an energetic black hole… we struggle to even drive out the gates due to unhelpful helpers engaging the lads and distracting them at every turn and I begin to feel like I’m in a zombie movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we stop at the beach I realise just how agitated I am from the experience and tell the lads there’s no way in hell I’m staying there so we move into the Unearth Hostel for a night. It’s a nicer spot, and also ran by complete stoners - though this time helpfully unhelpful folk that are quite independent and not looking to feed on the brains of their new arrivals.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wishing to book a meditation in the Matrimandir, myself and Jimi head off to look for the famous golden egg. Instead we end up rather lost and while checking google maps for directions a seemingly friendly bull decides to headbutt Jimi. A couple of passing girls laugh at this ask if were lost, like I mean no shit, but it turns out that they are in a similar position and looking for a sound healing session. As this sounds better than searching out a booking office that’s probably closed, we decide to join them instead for this excursion instead. Turns out to be a good choice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;This is an image&quot;src=&quot;road.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
Yeah, we’re lost.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon arrival we’re invited to lie down comfortably, close our eyes and just let ourselves to be. If movement surfaces in our bodies, just honour it gently. It’s a stereoscopic spree of polyphonic harmonics; instruments of all varieties played in the full sound scape of the auditorium. Real life surround sound. As I allowed my consciousness to drift around the various elements, I sensed a number of crystalline brain structures dissolving in the layer cake of neutral semantic energy, evaporating from my body in the form of tears. More lachromony, this time of a subtle variety.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning back to the Unearth Hotel we’re recommended a nearby cafe for food where we can have dinner, make use of the internet and take various calls. An old peer calls me out of the blue; he’s now hacking banks as a white hat and serendipitously wishes to hook me up with a cryptographer friend that’s been training him in.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes please mate, that sounds great - though I’m a little concerned he’s now hacking banks… I’m pleased to hear that he’s finally got comfortable employment that suits him well as a white hat; though such a skill set could be a double edged sword as he could very easily end up as public enemy number one if he happens into hard times again… he’s grown up on the worst estate of the UK monopoly board and is consequentially unfused about the moralities of normative society; perfect red team material as white hat - hopefully it goes well and lasts!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rishi sends me some stuff that the NAO folks are doing on “Greencheck” identity; really cool way of doing sibyl proof humanity. Framed in the context of previous work a picture really starts to paint itself. Brad also seems to recognise the overlaps and enthusiastic to do some work together; I guess I’ll have to write up a synthesis of all this identity stuff at some point soon. In the meanwhile we send each other various pieces of work and notes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jash, an old friend of Rishis, arrives in the evening and gifts me a creative artefact they both worked on that’s truly exxxxceeelllent!! Like a sign from the chaosmos its a synchronicity that’s far too weird to be causal in any linear or causal way; there’s a letter enclosed that seems to pertain to my time at the Regen Foundation suggesting that my hesitancy in action has completely sunken a boat… yes; this is a rather schizoid association to make but seriously WTF!!? It just gets weirder everyday…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;This is an image&quot;src=&quot;cal.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;This is an image&quot;src=&quot;letter.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just gets weirder everyday…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for descending this far, yeah - we are now in the belly of the beast so you might consider checking out the next part of the story for upward momentum and resolve as it’s the best part of the Auroville journey!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description xml:base="https://joshafairhead.com/travel/indiapt2/">&lt;div class=&quot;cover-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;This is an image&quot;src=&quot;Ganesh.jpg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no plans laid out post Green Pill Festival; myself and Rishi drove overnight to Bangalore in order to get his new lady friend Aaba to hospital and back home.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most likely scenario was that she had a stomach bug from nibbling on a kiwi fruit that was in turn nibbled on by a rat; while speculative, this situation seems pretty plausible given there were apparently two other run-ins with rodents that evening while we were on the road down…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jimi ended up needing rabies shots due to a bite on his finger; while Marco awoke up to something fuzzy on his leg which he promptly kicked into the roof making an audibly large thud - as there was no body was identified it seems likely a rodent who somehow survived the impact. Ouch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;This is an image&quot;src=&quot;CherryBlossoms.png&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides these events, all parties made it to Bangalore good spirits and met up for coffee after a good nights rest. Sino, Marco, Rishi, Jimi and myself met with Jacob and his lovely co-founder to learn about local design, indigenous crafts and supply chains before geeking out on blockchain economics. By and large this discussion was a demonstrative means to confer the value of diagrammatic reasoning and conversation graphs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a Thursdays internetting with Rishi and Sino we decide to try and visit a temple together. Departing the coffee shop I receive a message from Jacob saying he’s interested in the excursion and walking towards us from his part of town. Detouring to pick him up at a restaurant we discover that the clock has already struck midnight and the temple is closing imminently. Cest la vie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“New plan; let’s head to Atlantis HQ and grab Marco”. Pinging him and others about our vector we receive no response and head over anyway only to discover that no one’s in. “Oh yeah they’re probably out for dinner with Sudebi and Probal”… “How do you guys feel about an escape room?” proposes Jacob, who’s suggestion passes almost instantly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohhohoho, another portal summoning the forces of charoder! Myself, Rishi, Jacob and Sino make a pretty awesome team as we naturally fall into appropriate roles. The high stimulus environment of blaring white noise and strobe lights has Sino pretty agitated though… and I’m handcuffed to his side!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within minutes, Rishi and Jacob are completely free of their chains and we get to work on a perspex puzzle that turns off the white noise generator; sweet relief! Its rather odd to still have the strobe light going but we get that off too; immediately Sino spots a key hanginging rather inconspicously by the speaker and were through the shutters into the next room.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What were all those number-plates about then? no bloody idea, I drop it and start to stare at a poster full of guns with code names and try to find a pattern as others work on a cryptic flow chart that opens up the next door… A shelf, items, some math on the back of a door and a computer…. “okay, what are we supposed to do with these?” I wonder.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh ok, the computer requires a password and that seems to be a code associated with one of the guns I was looking at. The lads are about to crack the shelving puzzle which determines the reference code for the gun.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got it, its AK3080 (or something). A song with gun shots… ok, count them? right - yeah that’s the next door code. Home straight indeed now lads; what’s this map of India all about? Yeah the string goes round all these posts for some reason… but which ones and why? Ohhh, back to the number plates at the beginning for the layouts…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YES Sino! Spot on, your right, it looks exactly like the symbol on all the props; what an interesting hermeneutic reference! X marks the spot so the Bangalore number plate is the final code? Clank, yup, we’re outta here! Drinks?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;This is an image&quot;src=&quot;EscapeRoom.jpg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday we’re invited to Utkarsh’s place in the evening so we call in a little early to do some co-working in with him and his friend Scooby. This takes us into a discussion on $Earthcoin, its tokenomics and general mechanism design. Jimi, working on a proposal in the other room periodically buzzes in and out to test his thinking and from there the conversation turns to bonding curves and liquidity pools.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we put the white board away a number of the Green Pill Festie folk start to show up at the house along with their various partners and girlfriends. The party’s a little fragmented but also relatively civil given there were freeskates and slacklines available to cause accidents! Ever the dry shite, I head home at about 1am to get some rest.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;This is an image&quot;src=&quot;Stalls.jpg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday is April 1st and as usual I’m playing the fool; having toured the design school and beautiful market with Marko and Sino during the first half of the day I attempt to make it over to a Polkadot event which is supposedly happening in the Sheraton hotel; I just happen to go to the wrong one… With the correct address an hour across town it seems the event will close by the time I arrive; I subsequently admit defeet (gettit?) and decide to look for shoes around the nearby shopping mall.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bump! - “Oh hello Sino,, fancy seeing you again haha! Marcos in Starbucks? Ok, cool - I’ll drop in for a moment to say hi. Hola mate, me again; get anything done? yeah I’ll try a sweet, what are they? mmm they’re are a little bitter sweet just like my day haha! Right, you guys are gonna do some shopping? I’ll stay here for some coffee and writing. See you back here in an hour or so.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an reasonably extensive writing session I wonder where they disappeared to, check a group chat and discover movement being planned across town… “Ok yeah, I’ll head over to the restaurant club thing you lot are meeting at”.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jumping in a rickshaw I ask the price. The driver says 2000 rupee; so I say forget it and begin to get out as it cost me 400 to get over so I figure it should be about the same back. The driver begins to haggle with me and we settle on 500. A few minutes later a change of venue comes in over the telegram and coordinates are actually closer, so I update the driver and he’s good with it - or so I believe. As we arrive at my destination he tries charge 2000 again…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We go back and forward on this as he’s intent on getting whatever he can and I’m intent on a reasonable and fair outcome. He tries a number of approaches including shame and anger, calling me a cheater and so forth which is all rather unpleasant so I give him the 5oo and angrily point to a cop car to settle things. His tone changes to panicked and rather weak so I give him another 100 to close the matter in sympathy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guru and Utkarsh arrive after a short wait in the restaurant, who upon hearing about my kerfuffle laugh and suggest that “it shoulda been 200 dude - book through Uber, the drivers always try to rip us off too!”.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of others begin to arrive in convoy now but as Marcos in shorts the venue refuses him entry so we decide to leave. Jimi has already hit the dance floor so we grab him and get into Utkarsh’s car and set off for a more local social club they frequent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we pull out of the car park we pass the others and suddenly drivers start to changing, people are rotating in and out of the car as logistics are figured out and after a little bit of turbulence and we’re on our way again. Dubstep on the radio, we somehow pass the others in a rickshaw… and then promptly leave them for dust.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we arrive, I reflect on the novelty of dropping the car off to the valet; a privilege I’ve never experienced before - probably because I’ve never had my own wheels or the cash to rent a car while visiting foreign countries - so it feels a bit like entering a James Bond casino in an odd kinda way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entry fee covers drinks and being a dry shite I don’t need them so Guru kindly pays my entry and redistributes the tokens; the place is pretty dope place. Way less flashy than the place we left in order to get here but more fun and quirky; it’s layout actually reminds me of a night club I used to tech manage.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about an hour the others travelling by rickshaw arrive just in time to get booted out for close. Myself and Rishi were gonna stay with Irthu but feeling pretty tired I wish them all a good night and set off to find myself a hotel as they move on to party. Finding a spot is less easy than expected but after checking a few non existent locations on google maps I stumble across the same hotel I checked out of in the morning in order to complete a perfect circle!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday is pretty graceful; I grab a coffee at my regular spot ‘talk over table’ and then head over to visit Irthu. Something really starts to light up as we jam on cosmology and myths of creation and after a while he asks me what LunarPunk Labs is doing…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoiding transcendental narratives to explain the mystery I’m swimming through I suggest ‘what’ is the wrong question as it’s generated from the ‘how’. He beams at this answer and recommends a book called ‘draw to win’ - oh yeah that lands.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrawling all over the desk he begins to share the Atlantean vision and his backstory of working with Mercy Corp. Holy fuck - he’s actually been there and totally legit; they were solving issues around the Indian water supply for years and actually got pretty far before pissing off some mafiosa, which forced them to close their company for safety reasons. Decentralisation was a means of moving forward while spreading the risk.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vision and narrative vibed for me but ever the pragmatist their crew history impressed me most; they’d been practising various forms of solidarity while co-living and getting their hands dirty. Irthu shared a number of designs patterns informed from their experience and the ontology was pretty tight. Super general and useable across numerous projects.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;This is an image&quot;src=&quot;Table.jpg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a disassociated technologist I’ve been going pretty meta to avoid opinionation while working at a functional level in my own designs as those closest to the problem are best suited to solve it. Ever hesitant to prescribe a particular ontology for this reason I’m glad to finally stumble into a set of opinions that actually count for something rather than some Refi marketing hype espoused by innocent fools who by and large have become brainwashed instruments of the ‘network state’.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussion continues into all kinds of subject matter often considered taboo or woowoo and my flame begins to burn brighter. Irthu has rather interesting edge that’s as explorative as my own and is just as sceptical. Seems we both love to run pattern analysis on novel perspectives when they come from a place of curiosity rather than ideology (too blackpilled to eat more of that!).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;This is an image&quot;src=&quot;Laptop.jpg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a healthy scepticism present in our convo but were also faaaar off piste into the free field of potentiality; ahh sweet refreshment. This is the type of interaction where the impossible suddenly seems to become possible; balanced flow in a far from equilibrium states… cause, choice, change!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;This is an image&quot;src=&quot;CroppedHutSunset.jpg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the precipice once again; searching for god knows what I jump a flight to Atlantis… I mean to Gokarna to meet Rishi in person for the first time; despite having shared a lot of time together online during the COVID period.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’d met the Atlantis team at Refi Bangalore who were convening a gathering called “green pill festival”; a retreat for founders and hackathon builders. We stayed here for a week hanging out with their crew while workshopping our way forward into the unknown.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;This is an image&quot;src=&quot;photo_2023-05-19-16.31.37.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving after 26 hours of travel I crashed out twice, only to awake at 4am in a jet lagged delirium before going for for a walk in the darkness to shake the fog. The atmospheres mysterious and electric, with chants vibrating through the air from across a nearby field. I attempt a search out the noise but am unable to locate the source so decide to vocalise in resonance instead while setting out for a walk across the beach. Suddenly there’s scuttling all round my feet; zippity clacky clack ziiiiiiiip - what the hell are these funky creatures? They’re fast as lightning and under the darkness of new moon it’s impossible to discern.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following another cycle of rest, I’m woken from a knock at my door; answering in my underwear I’m briefly introduced to an unexpected room mate that I’ll be sharing space with who’s name is Raj. “Come on in man, get yourself sorted - about time I got up anyway”. Another knock, this time Kieran from the Atlantis team. “Do you wanna do some yoga?” he asks, “Great timing, yeah, that’s just what I was thinking about” - “Ok then, its happening in ten minutes over on the beach!”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage I’m feeling pretty much recovered from all the sleep and exercise and now realise what the night scuttlers were; crabs coming out of their burrows under cover of the new moon during low tide. As we do sun salutations on the sand a number of jokes are cracked about them emerging only to bite asses.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my way back to shower, I cross paths with Guru who’s a little concerned about the retreats programming and facilitation so offer a hand. We sit down to sequence and embellish the workshops he’s put together and I’m thoroughly impressed by the containers developed based on Wilburs integral theory (essentially a western appropriation of Aurobindos work). As it turns out, I’ve little to contribute to the programme other than a few loose ideas as the workshops are set and well sequenced; the best I can offer is some reassurance in hopes of relieving pressure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utkarsh tangentially joins us at the table and we talk about the contextual realities surrounding regeneration and the forces that need to be confronted. It’s refreshing to have a break from narratives as we dive into market jujitsu; he really gets this and over the rest of the week the two of us share a number of discussions; feet in the water we discuss cosmology, markets, science, technology, ideology and spirituality.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;This is an image&quot;src=&quot;photo_2023-03-31-15.27.12.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without needing to say anything much there’s a lot of resonance; our discussions are essentially pleasant verbalisations due to the novel sense of complementarity. We share and learn. One particular gem he informs me of is that the Vedics leveraged their precise cosmology to record historical events against planetary movements as a means of verification; more cosmological logistics!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the weeks workshops play out the facilitators hold space well despite our open environment presenting distractions like the nearby juice stall. We dive into communication practices with Jacob from Terregeneration; a gentle soul who spent several years of his life cleaning up a mountain he and his partner moved to. As attention wanes with the approaching sunset other facilitator types like Didi step in to heard the cats and keep the timings on course.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;This is an image&quot;src=&quot;photo_2023-03-31-15.26.14.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the light begins to fade with sunset over sea I spend a bit of time juggling which opens up a conversation with Jacob. In the meanwhile, Utkarsh playfully steals a stray ball and disappears with it probably believing his actions have gone unnoticed which leaves Jacob mildly nonplussed, informing me that “someone” has taken the prop. As our conversation winds down Utkarsh appears from the darknesse to reveal himself as the thief and return it as a fellow agent of balanced chaorder!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final workshop is pure gold. It’s a role playing game called “its just business” which leads to outright chaos. Participants are enrolled into a ficticious scenario regarding a fictional island and asked to inhabit roles within this multi-stakeholder ecosystem; there’s an international airline looking to capitalise on tourism, the local government, fishermen, conservationists, youth, elders and such.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we go about negotiations with eachother the occasional news flash is broadcast regarding the state of international affairs - which in turn changes the political dynamics. After the negotiation stage we return to a plenary session in order to articulate each groups positions to the government, who makes a final call on what’s to happen while simultaneously trying to stay in power by appeasing all parties.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohhohoho man, this is when things got as fragmented as the house of commons during Brexit; there was tons of booing, hissing and an almighty racket as the various factions fought over their values. It was brutal and many of the representatives were genuinely rattled by the uproar and froze. The youth were particularly disruptive having made an alliance with the airlines (who having dismissed the fishermen had “we’ve got boats” repeatedly chanted at them - yes guilty, that was me)…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally the government made their decision to allow the airport and were unanimously voted out of power - even by the airlines - who as it turns out, had embraced corruption by impersonating the government in order to achieve their ends! What a bloody mess… but thankfully only a simulation! You can’t win them all.
The ‘business’ consortium&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;no-hover&quot;alt=&quot;This is an image&quot;src=&quot;photo_2023-03-31-15.30.11.jpeg&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday is our day in Gorkana and a few special guests are passing through to see whats happening. A green investor that Pranav knows and Grishna a cosmic Russian touring India in search of wisdom who offers us a tea ceremony. In the evening we say our goodbyes and head to Bangalore.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first in a series exploring a generative journey through technology, music, and human coordination&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look around society at large, you’ll find that most people are specialists who do one thing well. In fact, society incentivizes and rewards such behavior, which in turn shapes people in its image. I’m not one of those people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, I’ve never been satisfied doing “just one thing” and have a drive to transcend disciplines while including new skills. Such people are often called “polymaths”, “generalists”, “multipotentiates”, “pantologists” or more simply “renaissance people”. We’re a minority in what seems like a sea of madness, but historically the most curious cats out there seem to fall into these categories: Plato, Pythagoras, DaVinci, Maynard James Keenan, Ted Nelson, Robert Fripp, Steve Jobs, and Sylvain Richard.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-guitar-as-gateway&quot;&gt;The Guitar as Gateway&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first skill I remember getting reasonably good at was the guitar, though it’s also the specialty I’m probably least proficient in since I learned without any particular framework or discipline. What started as teenage fascination with rock music on an electric guitar gradually matured into acoustic appreciation, but I wasn’t content to limit myself there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started picking up a cornucopia of other instruments: drums, bass, mandolin, harmonica, didgeridoo, and just about anything else physically available to me. This musical exploration opened doors I hadn’t expected - like many creative pursuits, one thing led naturally to another.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guitar led to a passion project that still makes me smile: building a replica Gibson Les Paul from scratch. It was a one-time endeavor, but the craftsmanship involved taught me about materials, precision, and the physics of sound in ways no textbook could. More importantly, it sparked an interest in home recording that would eventually lead to a Masters degree in Audio Technology.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;beyond-music-physical-coordination&quot;&gt;Beyond Music: Physical Coordination&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En route to that masters, I took what might seem like a detour through circus arts, dance, and object manipulation. Combined with board sports, these pursuits helped hone my physical dexterity and coordination in ways that complemented my musical development.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juggling, in particular, fascinated me with its own symbolic language called siteswap - a notation system for describing types of throws. The intersection of physical skill and abstract mathematical representation felt like a preview of deeper patterns I’d encounter later.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-recording-years-from-festival-stages-to-creative-commons&quot;&gt;The Recording Years: From Festival Stages to Creative Commons&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finishing school, I decided to take a year out to earn cash for serious recording equipment - a top-of-the-range MacBook Pro and a second-hand Digidesign 002 desk from a professional musician. This investment would prove crucial for what came next.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A peer and I volunteered to do live sound at a music festival and ended up running a small tent with no scheduled acts. So we took on stage management duties, recruiting anyone we saw moving between stages with instruments. While scouring the waterlogged plains of the ironically named “Solace” festival, we stumbled upon a local Cork band called Neon Flea Circus.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invited them to play - they obliged with a blistering gig, and we offered to record them. This project took on a life of its own across various locations, and with whatever equipment we could cobble together, we recorded a creative commons album that absolutely bloody rocked.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we were releasing the art for free, I became deeply interested in the commerce aspect of music marketing. I decided to handle album promotion for my final year project, working with both Neon Flea Circus and another band we met at Solace called “Sons of Gingerbread”. Surprisingly, we managed to turn a profit from releasing a free album in conjunction with a national tour and merchandise. These efforts earned me a first-class degree and a scholarship for a masters program.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;masters-research-the-deep-questions&quot;&gt;Masters Research: The Deep Questions&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my two-year part-time masters, I spent time investigating how we subjectively interpret sound, driven by the fundamental question: “What is music?”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This inquiry led me to prototype ‘musical’ distortion units in MaxMSP, tracking and manipulating fundamental frequencies. Surround sound recording techniques caught my attention too - I wanted to understand how we capture the sound of physical environments and reproduce such richness in our living rooms.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I experimented with various techniques leveraging head-related transfer functions: binaural heads, Hamasaki squares, and optimized cardioid triangles. All were different models for mapping acoustic terrain in various ways.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, my research culminated in the age-old debate of analogue versus digital - specifically tubes versus transistors. This investigation surfaced the inherent laws of vibration and what Pythagoras meant when he proclaimed “the octave never repeats.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breakthrough came when I discovered that tubes produce second-order (rather than third-order) harmonic distortion, leading to intermodulation frequencies (sum and difference) and giving rise to the Pythagorean musical scale at smaller and smaller fractal dimensions. The mathematics of music had revealed itself through technology.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;self-indulgence-and-sonic-depth&quot;&gt;Self-Indulgence and Sonic Depth&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my masters project, I decided to get self-indulgent, writing and recording a concept album in 5.1 surround sound. The production turned out well - lyrics, songwriting, musicianship, and recording all came together - though I’ll admit it wasn’t as life-affirming as the Fleas material I’d previously poured my heart into.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more sterile “professional” spaces seemed to reduce the music’s dimensionality, even if the sonic depth was of higher fidelity. It scratched an itch for self-expression and let me wear many hats, but it taught me something important about the relationship between technical perfection and soul.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;lessons-in-making-and-meaning&quot;&gt;Lessons in Making and Meaning&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These early years established patterns that would define my approach to everything that followed. I learned that curiosity could bridge seemingly unrelated domains - from guitar building to acoustic physics, from festival management to music marketing, from juggling notation to harmonic mathematics.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, I discovered that the most meaningful projects often emerged from necessity and serendipity rather than planning. The Neon Flea Circus project succeeded because we said yes to an opportunity and figured out how to make it work. The masters research yielded insights because I refused to accept simple answers to complex questions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The polymath path isn’t just about collecting skills - it’s about finding the hidden connections between disciplines and using those intersections to create something new. Each domain I entered enriched my understanding of the others, creating a foundation that would prove essential as I moved from sound waves to light shows, from analog circuits to blockchain protocols.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-s-next&quot;&gt;What’s Next&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This foundation in music, technology, and creative production would soon lead me into the world of live entertainment - running sound and lights for clubs and venues across London. But that’s a story for the next post, where the lessons learned in bedroom studios would scale up to nightclub sound systems, and where learning through necessity would become a defining characteristic.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guitar had opened the first door. Many others were waiting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Next in the series: “From Sound Waves to Light Shows: Technical Theater Years” - where bedroom recording skills meet the demands of London’s nightlife scene.
