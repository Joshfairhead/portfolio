<a href="http://joshportfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/Unsigned_not_Wasted.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="Unsigned_not_Wasted" src="http://joshportfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/Unsigned_not_Wasted.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="158" /></a>This was a discussion held by the MPG with panel members Karen Emanuel from Key Production, Jonathan Quarmby from AWAL, Michael Fuller from AIM, James McGuiness from Absolute Marketing &amp; Distribution, and Tommy D from the MPG at one of the largest studios in London; Metropolis.

The talk was centered around independent music marketing–a subject I have a keen interest in–with the panelists discussing key points they felt important to a DIY artist. There were many topics covered such as permission marketing and social networking which are principal tools in a DIY musicians arsenal.

However its not just mailing lists (permission marketing) that should interest musicians as  the panelists agreed that statistics were a huge factor in the making of a success story. The key being to analyse statistics in order to reveal relevant information and then leveraging it to plan a campaign around. For instance Jonathan gave the example of Imogen Heap tracking illegal downloads (presumably through BitTorrent IP) in order to geo-target her fan bases and then plan tours in their most concentrated area. This kind of practice is nothing new but there were some interesting points and statistics throughout the discussion and one point in particular that made a lot of sense was ‘do not strike a digital distribution deal if you plan to release physically at a later date’ (as a physical distributer will not touch the release at that point).

At the end of the end of the discussions and the question round, I had a short informal discussion with Jonathan about his views about why iTunes is so necessary given that they will not divulge any marketing information (such as location or a fans e-mail) to a content provider. He believed that there were numerous benefits such as iTunes promotion if a track is performing well, but ultimately agreed that they were somewhat of a necessary evil. I also wanted to get his perspective on other issues such as micro-payments, but ran out of time...
