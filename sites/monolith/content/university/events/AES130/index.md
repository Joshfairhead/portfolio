This was the first time I’ve managed to go to the AES and it was a great experience; I attended many lectures, seminars and a few technical committees. 

Probably the best presentation of the convention was a tutorial by Florian Camerer entitled  “Loudness and EBU R 128 - A Basic Tutorial of the Why and What”. This was such a polished presentation it puts most TED talks to shame and I really have to hand it to Florian for his shear passion on the subject.

His talk centered around audio normalization based on loudness–rather than peaks–by keeping the average level at -23 LUFS +/- 1LU (Loudness Units Full Scale) which are essentially dBFS but with the input is weighted so as to ignore short/medium term peaks concentrating on the ‘perceived average’ working level. Its probably excessive to have 23dB of headroom in music but if broadcasters conform to this standard it would make sense to have all audio levels at the same standard and thereby reaping similar advantages (i.e. the loudness war wouldn’t need exist).

Heres a list of some of the main AES events I attended:
