<a href="http://joshportfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/IOUs-Cover.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-100 alignright" title="Fistful of IOUs" src="http://joshportfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/IOUs-Cover-300x285.jpg" alt="" width="208" height="198" /></a>


The album ‘Fistful of IOUs’ was entirely self funded by the band and consequently the budget was what you could call ‘shoe string’.The rooms used for recording were selected from a handful of possibilities but was generally in the homes of the band members. All the equipment was either personally owned, borrowed, rented on the cheap or generally cobbled together from a variety of sources.

The setup consisted of my Focusrite Saffire (as ADAT preamps/converter), Digidesign 002 and Macbook Pro paired with Darrens TLAudio Ivory II. The microphones at hand were an AKG D112, 2x AKG C1000s, a Sure Beta 57, a Sure Sm58, a Studio Projects B1 and a rented/not always available Neumann TLM 103 with a pair of AKG C2000s.

<h2><strong>Drums</strong></h2>
<a href="http://joshportfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/Made_Of_Wood.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-821" title="Made_Of_Wood" src="http://joshportfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/Made_Of_Wood-271x300.jpg" alt="" width="190" height="210" /></a>These were recorded in an oddly shaped living room that had a slanted celling and plenty of natural diffusion from items such as books, records and other assorted objects. Luckily the flooring of the recording space also consisted of a non-uniform wooden surface that contributed to an acceptable room tone.

The keyboard player suggested that we nail some absorbent material to the walls and assured us that the landlord wouldn't mind; so blankets of various densities were attached to critical areas such as the room corners to reduce the amount of reflections in the room overall and thus lower the possibility of unwanted comb-filtering (as the walls themselves were pretty much bare).

Due to a lack of balanced cabling/connectors the drummer had the formidable task of playing with only one earphone working; simply nothing could be done here because an unbalanced guitar cable was supplying a cheap headphone amp from with a sole TRS input. Regardless of this the drummer was quite happy and was still able to play pretty well hearing the click in one ear, and then his drums within the room without a problem. Luckily he did not want a guide track because he knew the songs inside out and could count the sections pretty easily once provided with the click.

The drums were positioned by beating a floor tom to find the most desirable resonance within the room; after which they were on placed a rug to reduce reflections in the overheads/slippage on the wooden floor [1]. After tuning the kit and setting the microphones in position we made the grave error of going for a break and opening the window; upon return we had to start the drum setup from scratch as the change in temperature/pressure was enough to completely detune the kit.

The microphone track list can be found <strong>here</strong>, however a notable aspect is that an AKG C1000 was used on the side of the snare rather than on the bottom. The main reason for this was down to personal taste; snare signals captured from the bottom of the drum rarely sound right to me and my preference is to record them from the side a few inches back from the shell to open up the sound of a top mic. This captures what I perceive to be a more natural sound with a softer but better defined ʻcrackʼ. One reason for this could be that the waveform caught by a side microphone contains a more complex signal which better represents the timbre created from the two membranes interacting between each other, the drum shell and the room.

Although the C1000 may not be the perfect mic it was the best condenser available for side miking; I’d normally consider it as having a bright and slightly brittle character, but in this case it worked quite well capturing a tone that didn't appear overly thin. This is quite possibly because of a boost in frequency response centered around 5kHz, followed by a dip centered around 7kHz; due to the fact that low frequencies mask higher ones this could account for the perceived ‘dull’ sound quality.

<h2><strong>Bass</strong></h2>
This was recorded in the guitar players flat which was an open plan, carpeted room with an adjacent kitchen and bedroom totaling somewhere around an oddly shaped 25 sq/m space. The small dimensions of this space could be seen as advantageous when recording this instrument due to inherent room modes existing in higher registers (in comparison to a bass guitars usual range). The only microphones used were an AKG D112 and Sure Beta 57; two contrasting microphones with different characteristics and positioning with the aim of giving blending options in the mix.
&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Keys</strong></h2>
<img class="size-medium wp-image-823 alignright" title="Whimsical" src="http://joshportfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/Whimsical-289x300.jpg" alt="" width="202" height="210" />

As the band lived above a doctor/dentist and were the only occupants of the building past 6pm (besides their flatmates) so we had access to record in a large stairwell spanning three floors. The keyboard used was a Nord Electro II running into a gigging Vox positioned halfway down the stairwell while the keyboard itself was place beside the recording rig at the top so as to separate the movement/performance noise from the microphones. The amp was stacked on a chair to somewhat decouple it from the ground and placed away from the room boundary (although there wasnʼt much leeway for movement).

For the organ sound on Of Dawn I used a Sure Beta 57 as a close mic and an AKG C1000 as an ambient mic placed further into the reflective field - roughly five meters down the stairs - which picked up a long reverb tail as a partial result of the room height and hard surfaces (stone wall). In the case of Whimsical Popsical the set-up was a slightly more privileged in that I had use of a Neuman TLM 103 for the day which was placed a foot from the grill with the same setup.

Upon reflection - pun intended - I would have preferred a stereo array for the ambient setup as it would contain extra spacial information and would have resulted in a more convincing room sound. Despite this however the mono ambience was still quite useful in feeding a reverb with some real early reflections during the mix stage.

The Rhodes sound recorded with the same setup as the organs, but in Of Dawns case a Studio Projects B1 replaced the TLM as we couldn't afford it... The first time the Rhodes enters in of dawn is for a solo; here the hands were tracked separately in order to allow flexibility in mix and had the added benefit of improving the performance.

<h2><strong>Guitars</strong></h2>
<a href="http://joshportfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/Keys_in_the_hall.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-336" title="Keys_in_the_hall" src="http://joshportfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/Keys_in_the_hall-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="158" /></a>All electric guitars were recorded in the same hallway as the keyboards however the setup differed depending on the song and so I refer you to the <strong>various track sheets</strong>.

In each track there were several layers of guitar; in respect to the track ‘Of Dawn’ there was a total of eight different parts recorded with double tracked main guitars, clean chords behind the key solo, a swelled section, a picked section then joins in with the swells before the overdriven solo arrives and then continues to the end of the track alongside double tracked driven chords which back the outro harmonies. The amplifier tone settings for each part were varied to try increase the separation between signals which would contribute to  a fuller guitar sound.

Made of Wood is the only track on the album that features an acoustic guitar; this was scavenged from a friend of the guitarists who was willing to lend his nice <strong>Martin </strong>for a good cause. This made life quite easy in that the instrument sounded great to begin with and was simply recorded with a pair of C1000s; one on the neck and one on the body.

The solos were all recorded in one night and in multiple sections by dropping the guitarist in every few bars at the points where we felt the solo lost momentum. Dan was quite open to any suggestions made to him and I feel that working linearly in this fashion - as opposed to recording multiple solos and making a compilation from different sections - was a great way of ensuring that the solos maintained focus.

<h2><strong>Vocals</strong></h2>
<a href="http://joshportfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/Of_Dawn.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-822 alignright" title="Of_Dawn" src="http://joshportfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/Of_Dawn-287x300.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="210" /></a>The different harmonies were double tracked with either a Neumann TLM 103 or a Studio Projects B1 depending on the track and remaining budget. The procedure was to record one good take as a guide and have the band harmonise to that replacing it with a better take and repeating the process once more to gain a ʻsecondʼ track. This approach ensured better takes as the musicians felt more comfortable recording to their own voices especially if the guide was close.

The main vocal in ‘Of Dawn’ was initially single tracked with the TLM 103, however later on it was decided that they should be doubled; this proved a problem as we could no longer afford to rent the TLM and so we made do with the SP B1 for the right channel. It was regrettable that this had to happen but having mismatched vocal microphones sounded better than two takes of the B1 or a single lead vocal with the TLM and so the result is whatʼs heard. The vocals on Whimsical was recorded entirely with the TLM and Made of Wood was recorded with just the B1.
&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Mix/Aims</strong></h2>
When mixing I often build the drum sound starting with the overheads as a foundation and the rest of the drum multi-tracks were phase aligned to these.

Due to the bands classic rock sensibilities; the drummer in particular expressed that he wanted a ʻsoftʼ kick. He admitted that really this meant he wanted to go to tape but since that wasnʼt a viable option I left a lot of its midrange in the mix and boosted very little of the beater click. Most of the kick drums sound actually comes from the use of a compressors attack/release setting which was the primary tool for tonal shaping (albeit also cleaning up some of the dynamics with about 2-3 dB gain reduction). However one trick I found useful was to use an equaliser to boost the low end into the compressor and then take out any excess afterwards which seems to tighten the low end... I’d hesitate to use this technique unless necessary though as the phase distortions from low frequency equalisation could be quite severe. In ‘Made of Wood’ the band performed a mock drum &amp; bass style ending and so I was asked to ‘make the click tear heads off’ in this section with excessive hi-end boosting for the kicks click like that found in the genre... In this respect I also compressed the bass quite heavily just for the ‘mockery outro’ section and automated a phasor effect to make things sound a little more synthetic that the traditional instruments present.

At one point the band were considering giving out the session files/session to interested bodies as a promotional tool and so the project was primarily mixed with the bundled plugins that come with pro tools; the only third party additions being an exciter on the harmonies and an amp simulator for processing the bass (which had a slightly dead tone and needed the help). The main plugins used were EQ3, Com/Lim3 and the AIR reverb because the band wanted to make the sessions available as downloads, which was an unfortunate trade off in quality but in the end their just tools to work with and requirements are requirements...

The most prominent instrument tracks were routed into their own auxiliary bus/group fader and given a designated reverb. The common use of the same artificial reverb to place the instruments/musicians in the same theoretical space in order to achieve an illusion of reality is a practice that works to a degree but lacks flexibility. An adaption to this practice would be to copy the effect to another channel or group allowing you to make minor alterations such as high/low frequency reverb time and ‘place’ musicians in the right room without effecting the other instruments.

Some compression was clearly necessary but most of the time there wasnʼt excessive dynamic reduction. I hold the belief that an engineers dependance on compression purely for level control is a counterproductive approach due to the natural dynamics of most recorded music; as the musician plays louder it is met by increased resistance from the compressor in question. A unwanted byproduct of such an approach also yields higher levels of uncontrolled harmonic distortion which can be avoided by first setting a working level through manual automation and then compressing.

As with any project there are many things I would now do differently that I learnt during the project (at which point it was too late) or after it was completed. There are two main methodologies to which I now work that were not incorporated in this project; the first is using automation to keep the signal level and micro-dynamics mostly consistent pre-compression and then writing the marco dynamics back in to the music afterwards. This essentially gives the compressor a signal of consistent overall level resulting in an output that doesn't radically alter in timbre with uncontrolled harmonic distortion.

The second thing is an awareness of the time smearing effects caused by equalisation due the principals by which a filter works and as such I’m a lot more cautious with my use of it (especially narrow bandwidth settings). On this album I mistakenly thought it to be a good idea to cut out the ʻinaudible low endʼ of a lot of instruments in order to increase headroom and get rid of low end rumble which I had often read about. This now seems like a mostly destructive process due to the phase ripple effect common in minimum-phase (IIR5) filter designs.. Understandably equalisation is necessary in places but now I’m more concerned about the trade offs between an EQs time-smear effects and its balance with the amount of frequency masking in the signal.

High pass filtering to instruments such as the bass guitar could be seen as destructive in regards to the audio as inter-aural timing differences (phase) are used to localise low frequencies. Despite this aspect only being in regard to the localisation of a sound and low frequency primarily being placed in the center (mono), introducing such phase distortions in the low end should be carefully considered or ideally accounted for with mic placement.
