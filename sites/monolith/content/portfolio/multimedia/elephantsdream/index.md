<h2><strong>Elephants Dream - Post Production</strong>

<p style="text-align: left;">This was for a module I studied on the Music Technology (specialist) BA; we were given the assignment of doing the post production (ADR, sound design and mix) for a clip of choice. Students were also allowed to work in pairs provided we double the playing length of the assignment (5 min) to ten minutes; which is exactly what myself and my housemate <a title="Darren Jennings" href="http://darrenportfolio.com/">Darren Jennings</a> did; choosing the 10 min open source movie '<a title="Elephants Dream" href="http://www.vimeo.com/1132937" target="_blank">Elephants Dream</a>' by the <a title="Blender foundation" href="http://www.blender.org/blenderorg/blender-foundation/" target="_blank">Blender foundation</a>.</p>
The original contained lip sync issues that really reflected quite badly on the animators considering that details like the lip smacks and breaths were animated but could not be heard. To redub the voices we built a large ‘dead space’ from mattresses and set up a second monitor inside along with a C414 (as a close mic) and a pair ofShunyun Cy90s (as a stereo distance pair a bit further back). The idea was to have our signals as dry as possible then apply ambience later so that we could account for the multiple onscreen spaces. Because of the originals lip sync issues we occasionally had to modify lines to fit the words to the characters lips better and were all synced by replaying the parts over and over until the delivery was right (or unfortunately in some cases as close as possible).

After this we had to create footsteps, clothing noise, breaths and lip smacks. Convincing footsteps sounds are surprisingly hard to get right and finding the right surfaces are pretty unintuitive; we often found that things like carpet sounded like gravel upon recording and to sound like they were on carpet another material of varying texture/density was needed instead (such as a pillow). The most fun part here was probably syncing Proogs breaths while he dances on some metal plates which come up to meet his feet from the abyss.

Creating the sound design was probably the most enjoyable aspect of the project, and because the animation was based in a weird ‘living machine’ there was plenty of room for creativity! 

The hardest bits to make were the huge metal arms throwing the pod and then its subsequent falling to pieces. The sound files were gathered by taking a Zoom H2 to some metal skips at 3am (when the traffic had quietened) and banging them with a golf club wrapped in masking tape (to soften the attack) which is easily the most memorable part of the project for me. 

We also got a good sample from banging a manhole cover with a shoe which gave a really nice heavy resonance and sounded huge! At the end as the Colossus appears we were knocking over bricks onto an old piece of cabinet and recording the sound with a D112 when we discovered a really nice low end quake could be created by dragging bricks along a metal bar attached to the cabinet while the mic stand was sitting on top and resonating in sympathy! 

Overall I think it turned out pretty well; there are parts that could use more sound design and the mix could be better but considering the ADR, movements, spots, sound design and mix were done in under a month (along with write ups) I think it turned out pretty well. I'd like to have filled in the tunnel with some ambient wind, added more high end layers to the Colossus (for small speakers) and a few more booms and crashes when its fist(?) hits the ground. Regardless of this our lecturer – Paul Bourg –  didn't see too many shortcomings and marked the project at 73% (a 1:1) which was nice of him.
