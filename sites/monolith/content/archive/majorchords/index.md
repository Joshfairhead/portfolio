Recently I've been playing with chords and have just discovered what people probably mean by voice leading; essentially once we start adding tension notes such as 7ths and 9ths we create more than one triad within a chord allowing them to be replaced by what would technically be called a different chord (though containing the same notes in a different inversion). For instance an Amin7 contains the notes ACEG which when played with a C bass is the same thing as a Cmaj6 which contains the notes CEGA; however each has its own distinct voicing which allows substitution of one for the other.

This is really handy for moving up or down in pitch in order to direct a pice of music towards chords that seem too far removed to be played in sequence or for adding a bit of interest to a stationary passage. This kind of thinking can be applied to lots of chords such as the Dominant 7 <strong>#</strong>9ths (AKA the Hendrix chord); even when a chord isn't complete the implied tonality is enough to let us get away with replacement. For instance E7(<strong>#</strong>9) contains E G<strong> </strong>B D  and F<strong>#</strong><strong>#</strong>/G, commonly played on a guitar we omit more solid note like 5ths for the tensions resulting is something like the picture on the left which has a dropped B and F##/G. This chord can obviously replace an E major but it can also 'pretend' to be a G major or B minor because of its close relation to each's contained notes (G B D and B D F# respectively).

It gets interesting when you realise that there is a world of new chords than can be moved to from these; if an E major is replaced by an E7(#9) we can think of it as being replaced by a G major which in turn allows us to progress to chords of a different harmonic relation or imply a different feeling. If you would like to hear this effect yourself just play an E maj in first position followed by a D maj, then the E7(#9) in the picture followed by a D maj, and finally a G maj in first position to the D major; the E maj clearly doesn't work so easily as the E7(#9) or the G major there by opening up another route to continue the progression...

In summary; if one knows what the next chord will be a substitution can be performed in order to steer away from the current progression into a new musical direction or just for flavour.
