# Home recording studio for five grand

To start my studio I would buy my studio mics, as they are the guts of a studio.

To start I would get an AKG D112 to mice up the kick drum. The D112 is the eq’d version of the D12 and is used by most to mic up the kick for a reason, it sounds good and costs €200. Another reason for getting the D112 is that its dynamic and is less susceptible to damage than a condenser and therefore is also suited to stage use and can handle the wear and tear of live gigs.

Second I would get a sure sm57 for the snare. These microphones are one of the most versatile microphones as they can be used both in studio work and live work they are dynamic and are quite strong. They can also be used on guitar cabs and occasionally female vocals though not often. As a mic they are a very good all rounder and cost €100.

For my hi-hats I would use a small condenser mic made by studio electronics in Japan called the se1a. This microphone is hand made and extremely good for the price. The reason I would use this mic is because condenser mic would give the hi-hats an extra ‘’shimmer’’ and would also be able to be used in several applications and used on more than just the hi-hats and so would allow me to buy less mic's and be more likely to keep to the budget of €5000 -cost €100

To mic up my toms I would buy 3 seinheiser E604’s for €120 each. These would mic up the floor tom, the left tom and the right tom. These mic’s have a very high sound pressure level handling capability and so will not distort easily. It is also strong and so can withstand the odd hit from a stray drumstick due to its glass fiber body and has low sensitivity to handling noise. It is a clip on mic and so does not need a stand saving money.

For my two overheads I would get audio technica At3035’s as they are large diaphragm condensers suitable for overheads. The large diaphragm gives them good detail and low noise they have a quite flat frequency range and as I would be buying two, I would have two matching mic’s for use as an xy pair and due to their flat response they could be used for many applications.

I now have eight mic’s costing a total of €1160. But a few mic’s need stands, as they are not supplied/are not clip on mic's. The AKG D112, the Sure Sm57 and the Studio Electronics Se1A need small mic stands costing €25 each and the two Audio Technica At3035’s need large stands costing €35 each making a total of €1305 so far.

Every mic needs a lead and there may be a need for a few extras so I have budgeted €100 for leads, as thomanns cheapest leads are under €6 this is plenty though these leads are not €50 each or use gold plating for “signal flow’’ ECT. It doesn’t mean they will be horrific and will be nearly as reliable provided they are not mistreated i.e. they will do what’s needed.

We also need a multicore cable so we don’t have cables running under doors or providing things for people to trip on. They allow for recording that’s in multiple rooms and is isolated from sounds e.g. having a singer in the control booth and the guitarist in the recording booth.

Now I have my mic’s and my cables I need something as my desk/input ECT. I could go one of two ways, I could buy an all in one recording desk with the ability to burn a CD/ record 8 channels at once/ has a minimum of 16 tracks. If I was to go this route I would get a Korg D3200 which costs €1500 or I could get a pro tools rig which is the path that I would take as pro tools is more user friendly than the desk and can do a lot more for the money also once protools out of date I can up date the software keeping most of the rig e.g. keep the computer and up-grade protools. I would get the Digidesign 002 rack with pro tools, which is a rack mountable interface it has enough inputs to meet the requirements of recording eight tracks simultaneously and if I ever need more inputs I can simply upgrade the 002 unlike the recording desk.

With a pro toolset up you also have a bigger screen to work on online the average 3’’ screen on any desk you find and if the computer screen isn’t big enough you can buy a bigger one or second screen and link them (or both). The disadvantages to buying pro tools set up is the initial cost. A disadvantage to pro tools is the fact that many people feel computer illiterate and find computers hard to use.

some people critisize protools for “sounding digital” due to the wave form being made up of thousands of lines making up the wave but pro tool is digital an any all in one desk/system is digital as well and will probably sound a lot worse.

Pro tools comes with effect plug-in’s and if need be new one’s can be bought unlike the desk where you would have to buy effects boxes for most effects. Plug-ins can also be downloaded off the internet for free in some cases and any pre-sets you create can be e-mailed or shared with others using the net e.g. altiverb pre-sets on the web allow you to download the acoustics of places like st pauls cathedral without going there.

Another advantage of pro tools is that if you learn to use the LE version you can quite easily use a million euro version which is hand for moving to a better version or working in a better pro tools equipped studio the computer I would run all this on would be an iMac G5 with a 1.8Ghz processor and a 17”screen costing €1185 from thomann.de. This computer is plenty for running protools on a limited budget. The down side to this computer is the screens small and there is only one, though a second one could be bought at a later stage. I would also buy beringer BCF2000 USB faders for operating the digital rig. They do not affect the sound in any way.

For head phones which I would need for if a musician was in the control room. I would buy bherodynamic dt150’s as they are a comfortable pair of headphones and are a reputable brand.

For monitors I would buy a pair of event tr6 reference monitors (tr =tuned reference) these monitors are 100 watts and are a bi-amp system. I would choose these as they consist of a speaker and amp in one. The tweeter dome is made of neodymium and is 25mm. the cone is polypropylene and is 6.5mm. These monitors have an xlr in and a 1/4 jack (trs and rca)

Finally I would buy a Clark technica DI box at a cost of €200 for a clear direct bass signal and other applications.
