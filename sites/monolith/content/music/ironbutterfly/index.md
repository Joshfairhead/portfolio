The recording sounds just like the band name; dense or heavy as but also has a somewhat weightless quality at times... Its a very 'tape' sounding album and is great in its 'floppy pillow' kind of way; lots of high end roll off, strong midrange but punchy as hell for instruments that sound so soft from plenty of saturation, its also quite dynamic which is nice.  The songwriting and musicianship on this album is pretty solid for psychedelic rock; at times it boarders on prog but only so much as having strange effects or eccentric runs that are still quite musical (not saying anything bad bout prog, I think its great). The first track is a pretty good example of what I'm talking about, beginning with what sounds like a spring reverb being shaken around followed by feed back and a distorted 'flapping' effect... The first time I heard this album I thought the intro was nicely done but also had my doubts about it, however as soon as Doug Inglis's powerful but shaky voice entered followed by 'dreamy' arpeggios played by the guitar along with some really haunting backing harmonies harmonies I was sold.

Standing out on the album is the track 'To Be Alone', again starting with a strange intro (this time with a slightly mad organ) building into a blues rock riff from a slide guitar. Ingles vocals seem at his most expressionate on this track, really cutting loose on the verse to a point where he sounds pretty uncontrollable. Closing off the album is 'I Can't Help But Deceive You, Little Girl' provided your not listening to the record... Another great track too, the really blocky keys combined with haunting harmonies support Ingle once more but jumps to a really great '70s funk bit playing the sections off each other like a really nice juxtaposition. Theres also a great bit in the guitar solo where the whole band follows the drummer on three muted cymbal hits, this is some how pulled off by the guitarist mid solo and shows how tight the band are.
