Nice tea, I don't believe it warrants the price (essentially £12.50 for 100g) as I have had other teas that taste a lot better for less (e.g Maharani Hills costing £8 for 125g).
Not too weak in terms of background strength which is a good thing in my books; but still a bit thin tasting lacking a real flavour hit. There is a possibility I'm over brewing this to get some extra body; but brewed any less it would just be too weak for me. I guess thats first flushes for you...
