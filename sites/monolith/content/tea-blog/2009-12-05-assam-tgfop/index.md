For the price its pretty good but its not excellent. It's got enough body in it to give a bit of a kick but without over powering you. The taste is not quite hitting woody but leaning in that direction. Its slightly above average on the bitter scale but not in a bad way. Long and short of it is that its an all right tea for everyday drinking when you want a bit of a hit and not exactly in the mood to really savour something. Its fine...
