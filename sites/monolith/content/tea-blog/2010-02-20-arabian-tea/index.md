This is a mix of unspecified black tea with things like cinamon ant other spices in it.
On first tasting its texture is quite thin like a Darjeelings or herbals would but with a bit more strength similar to Earl Grey and a flavour obviously leaning in the Chai direction.
Despite only being a person for normal black teas this Earl Greyish Chai isn't too bad. If your into your milky Chai then you could probably mix it with milk in a similar fashon but for me its just a variant on black tea.
