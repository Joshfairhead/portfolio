Although the shop assistant did not know what the blend actually consisted of, I would hazard a guess at it being a Ceylon blend mixed with Darjeeling; it has a full bodied taste while also being relatively light. One nice aspect is that it doesn't get bitter if brewed too long or if left to cool. Overall it has a slightly woody character with floral over tones lending to a nice high-midrange taste.
