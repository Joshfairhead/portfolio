So a kinda mellow Darjeeling that tastes pretty much as expected; nothing more, nothing less...
Medium strength thats nice and easy for night time drinking but equally suited to daytime drinking.
If your looking for a morning waker upper then maybe not the best tea for the job. Other than that its pretty good for everyday drinking considering the price.
