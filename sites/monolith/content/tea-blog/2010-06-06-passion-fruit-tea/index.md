Very round and light, a real summer tea. The passion fruit flavour really comes out as the tempreture drops; getting sweeter as it cools to a nice tempreture to drink at. The Chinese black tea could be better quality but if combined with the Orange Pettiagalla Celyon from a couple of posts ago it can taste pretty damn good. Another good addition to this combination is The Blue Lady tea, which in the right quantaties works pretty well.
