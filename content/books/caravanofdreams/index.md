Caravan of Dreams is a parade of pluralistic perspectives, illiminating various facets of timeless wisdom through the tradition of Sufi story telling. What's most remarkable is the wisdom conveyed between the lines, ambigous messaging deliberatly concealed to draw out ones interpretative abilities. 

In such a respect, it's said that each story is like a seed that may eventually germinate into something more substantial upon it's realisation. This may never happen but given sufficient time and life experience a garden may bloom in the mind of the reader. My own interpretative lens suggests that much of what was never said, yet that which is seemingly recognisable, seems based upon sound foundations - especially stories such as those on foolslandia or about animals. It's a weird old world and wisdom is one of the ways of navigating it. 

Some stories, with knowledge of Shas background, even provide some form of magical meta context, reading as though at times that Shah is inhabiting or being inhabited by a number of perspectives and writing the narrative of what seems like various school yard squabbles playing out between his inner and outer cosmos. This is itself quite illuminating and perhaps later prepares the reader for the reality they may soon be faced with? 

To that end, some stories are a few pages and others are a few lines, the latter of which feel, to my senses, more potent - often with the elegance of a haiku.
