## Distortion and Subjective Audio Quality – Mark Irwin

In the paper Distortion and Subjective Audio Quality, Mark Irwin^1 talks about various types of audio processing, the resulting types of distortion in both the analog and digital domains and the subjective viewpoints of people within the audio industry.

Irwin starts the article with a broad definition of linear and non-linear distortion from the paper: The Effect of Nonlinear Distortion on the Perceived Quality of Music and Speech Signals.^2 This paper defines linear distortion as changes to the relative amplitudes and phases of a complex signal and defines non-linear distortion as being the introduction of frequency components that were no present in the input signal.

Although fitting with the provided definitions, Irwins examples of these distortions could lead to confusion; the frequency response of the ear, dependent on volume, is non-linear in behaviour. However these distortions produced at specific volumes could be viewed as linear in that they can be directly correlated to the input level at a given volume.^3 Aside from this lack of clarity; Irwins main point is that given the complexities in our hearing and audio equipment makes capturing sonic events is a complex task.

Irwin then gives a brief history of amplifier design and the different properties of valve and transistor technology and their relative distortions, which leads to the question: what is musical distortion?

Due to such a subjective question, Irwin summarises findings in the paper Tubes vs. Transistors-Is There an Audible Difference? by Russell O. Hamm.^4 According to these tests valves have strong 2nd & 3rd harmonics with the 4th & 5th present but at reduced level and that transistors have a strong 3rd harmonic with others being present but at a greatly reduced level.

These harmonic profiles could be correlated with the acoustic properties of various instruments and the subjective viewpoints of how we relate this to pleasing harmonic distortion. However Irwin points out that despite the majority of subjective evidence (i.e. peoples opinions) is in favour of tubes having a more ʻmusicalʼ sound; some designers feel that results are dependent on design philosophy.^5

Irwin then goes on to discuss phase distortion, which can be described as a shift in time to the input signal due to inherent circuit resistance. Here Irwin makes the point that the ʻshapeʼ of the distortion envelope over time could be just as important as harmonicdistortion in our perception of warmth. This is then related to our hearing and the accepted psychoacoustic theory of Head Related Transfer Functions (our spatial hearing
mechanisms). 

Irwin argues that distortions in phase and frequency response will lead to
less realistic reproduction in the recording chain due to these functions; Inter-aural Timing Differences are dependent on phase to localise sound, while Inter-aural Intensity Differences rely on difference in frequency energy between signals for localisation.^6 A valid point however Irwin then states ʻvalve designs can be guaranteed to add predicable and pleasant colouration to the recording chain.ʼ

Although popular opinion holds the belief that valves impart musical distortion; ʻpleasant colourationʼ is still a subjective evaluation and as such cannot be guaranteed. This however should not distract from the main point that producers and engineers rely on phase and harmonic distortion to achieve a desirable outcome.^7

This subject gravitates to the underlying question: Is analogue better than digital?

Its been shown that there are complex non-linearities in analog equipment that effect the signal such as phase and harmonic distortion and that these distortions are characterised in the perception of a ʻwarmʼ sound. However these distortions in the digital domain are hard to emulate; as frequencies tend towards a Nyquist limit at 22.05Khz the phase shift becomes increasingly severe and often perceived as unnatural.^8 This is bad news to people that hold Rupert Neveʼs point of view: “frequencies well outside of the normally accepted limits of human hearing can be perceived”.^9

Despite this phase shift, a digital EQ/Compressors gain stage is more transparent in harmonic distortion often causing engineers to over apply the effect in an attempt to compensate, introducing further phase shifts.^10

Irwin presents several points of view on the subject of re-issues and why they donʼt sound the same as an original. An electronic reissue has components are usually different from the original and therefore the distortion caused by these components has changed. In digital emulations its essentially a necessary simplification of the original unit (limited by processor cycles) which in turn changes the distortion characteristics.

When discussing tape distortion Irwin points out the limited dynamic range of tape in comparison to our hearing and even low bit rate digital systems (16bit). He goes on to point out that engineers will commonly record at higher input levels to avoid the noise floor inherent in the format, leading to colouration. As Irwin states:

"...tape naturally compresses the signal particularly when overdriven. This effect generally results in the loss of high frequency information, resulting in a 'thicker' and 'warmer' sound than the original source."^11

The importance of non-linear distortion is a hot topic in mastering and broadcast industries today, commonly known as the ʻloudness warsʼ. Engineers are limiting the peak values in digital audio to achieve higher levels resulting with the introduction of subjectively ʻunpleasantʼ non-linear distortion. Due to this Irwin calls for the establishment of a metering system that takes into account distortion, stating that ʻThe problem of course, will be, persuading manufacturers to adopt this new measurement systemʼ.^12

In summary distortions are highly subjective and can range from subtle and pleasing to obvious and irritating, the main issue is more how they are used to achieve an end result. To do this knowledge and understanding of how they are introduced is extreamly
important.

^6 In Robert Jourdains book, Music, the Brain & Ecasty (1997) p203, itʼs stated ʻThe whole point of the brain is to moveʼ, this lends further credibility to Irwins point. If this statement is taken as true, phase distortions (based in the time domain, the same as motion) could correlate to our perception of natural sound and therefore could be just as important as harmonic distortions in relation to our subjective judgement.

# Notes made on the Article

## Abstract
Says that according to conventional spec’s digital should perform better than ‘Classic devices’ but the popularity of analog devices poses the question that “perhaps there are qualities the technical spec’s aren’t measuring” or that it could just be clever marketing. Explains its purpose is to just gather thoughts.

### Research Methodology
Not primarily scientific
Explains that he reviews existing literature and then used interviews.

1. "Auditory Perception of Nonlinear Distortion", Earl R. Geddes et al. presented at the 115th convention of the Audio Engineering Society, 2003.

2. "The Effect of Nonlinear Distortion on the Perceived Quality of Music and Speech Signals", Chin-Tuan Tan, Brian C.J. Moore and Nick Zacharov, Journal of the Audio Engineering Society, November 2003.

### What is distortion in audio recording
3. P-1012, p-3, 4,"The Effect of Nonlinear Distortion on the Perceived Quality of Music and Speech Signals", Chin-Tuan Tan, Brian C.J. Moore and Nick Zacharov, Journal of the Audio Engineering Society, November 2003.

Seems to confuse linear and non-linear distortion “Human hearing also produces linear distortion; frequency response is dependant on level and is far from flat at any volume; therefore any audio processor that measures a technically 'flat' frequency response is unlikely to sound 'flat', or even, to a human operator.” 

### Valves or Solid State?
I would argue that analogue processors in particular also impart harmonics that can be pleasant. When creatively applied, these offer distinctive additions to the audio producer's art. - Doesn’t say which type of distortion.
         
Summerises research about tube & transistor and relates to musical balance of harmonics. tubes add 2&3rd Transistors dominant 3rd.
Says design is the important factor. "Tubes Versus Transistors - Is There an Audible Difference?"5 Russell O Hamm.

### Phase

Ted Fletcher relates this to the question of audio warmth: "warmth' in an audio signal is usually a particular juxtaposition of phase relationships across the audio spectrum; it is personified by slight but smooth phase lag at both ends of the audio spectrum. More particularly, what causes 'lack of warmth' is any incidence of sharp phase shift that has been artificially introduced, whe	ther by design (with effects) or accidentally by poorly designed equipment."

Explains the phase difference between solid state and valve designs, concludes that high quality design is better.


### Eq

Talks about high bandwidth then questions weather or not analog is better.
Kemp also suggests that with enough processing power, devices can be designed to convincingly re-create the compound effects created by analogue circuits. He also sees racks full of outboard processors, being replaced by one programmable digital system. - WTF?

### Plug-ins

Opinions that plugs don’t sound like analogue co parts.
As Ted Fletcher states: "in most cases, digital emulations cannot emulate analogue equipment properly for the simple reason that any renowned equipment has highly complex effects on the sound, many of which are outside the knowledge of the digital programmer. - nice qute but no reference

### Compression

makes his case that choice is pragmatic because of a compressors ‘colour’

### Reissues

Don't sound the same because of their components or in the case of digital because its a simplified version of the circuit (given enough processing power and proper design theoretically  they should be identical)

### Tape

Summarises tape history and distortion

### Mastering

Argues that despite current technology getting better audio is degrading

As Lund states:22 "several golden ears in the industry feel that the best sound in pop and rock was produced between 1982 and 1995. Despite higher resolution in converters and DSP, lower jitter and probably a better overall understanding of the digital media, we seem to be on a declining rather than inclining sound quality slope even though the people buying records and films may not be conscious of it."

Finally I have a quote from mastering engineer Bob Ohlsson:24 "...the biggest problem has been the wholesale replacement of skilled audio operators by an ever heavier-handed use of compression. Broadcasting is often un-listenable because nobody with their hands on the controls is being paid to listen anymore."

And what about frequency? We can ‘hear’ a range of frequencies from about 25Hz up to around 14KHz.  That can be measured as the ‘frequency response’ of our ears, but natural and musical sounds extend from as low as 8Hz and up to 40 to 50KHz.  Is that relevant? Absolutely!! - Ted Fletcher
