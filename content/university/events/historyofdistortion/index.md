# London College of Music Masterclass - The History of Distortion

This was a talk came about after I requested a talk–on the basics of electronics and how circuit design could shape distortion characteristics in audio equipment–from an LCM lecturer Andy East who was formally a product manager at Vox Amplification. 

Andy agreed to this but suggested a primer on the subject first by discussing the history of amplifier distortion and how the sounds came into existence while providing audio examples. This made perfect sense and as pointed out by Andy its significantly easier to understand what your trying to create when you understand the history behind current designs.

In this regard the talk focused on groups like the Yardbirds cutting speaker cones and tracks like Link Wrays ‘Rumble’ (also noting the latters odd meter). The talk then shifted from the first signs of distortion to the early pedals which used Germainian transistors and sounded pretty nasty, although some people pay ridiculous sums for these simple pedals because they’re now vintage...  

Another topic was desk distortion and the change from tubes to transistors; famous recordings such as ‘Silly Love’ coming from 10cc as an example of a tube desk sound or various transistor based distortion recordings coming from overloading the desk in the Rolling Stones Mobile. On a similar note–because Deep Purple used the Stones Mobile to record ‘Smoke on the Water’ in Switzerland–the organ was actually run through an overdriven Marshall. This was quite a nice insight as I’ve always wondered how they got that great metallic sound which blended with the guitars so well... should really have guessed that to be the method.

After the lecture and also upon request Andy recommended a few books to get started with and then suggested we stay in contact about learning electronics, while trying out some practical projects.
