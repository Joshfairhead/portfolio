This event was a lecture by Keith Howard a journalist for several hi-fi magazines and specialist on distortions.

The talk centered around calculating a devices nonlinear response and the problems/restrictions of 1:1 input/output mapping. The discussion revolved around the importance of phase in harmonic distortion and how this is significant in our perception of these added artifacts. Howard also demonstrated his simulation software which he was using to facilitate research into the subjective significance of different distortions.

Over all the talk was pretty interesting although some of it was above my head (some of the equations for instance); however I did understood a decent portion of the discussion thanks to completing a Digital Audio Interface Design module at the start of the academic year along with a body of research on the subject. Still I want to get a better grasp on these ideas so I'll probably start looking at equations again fairly soon...
