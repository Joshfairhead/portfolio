This workshop was quite interesting; it tackled issues such as picture synchronisation, dither, compression and future proofing. 

The moderator was Crispin Murray of Metropilis Mastering who was joined by his collegue Mazen Murad, along with Ray Staff from AIR mastering and Dave Woolley form Thornquest (ex-AIR mastering) who were also on the panel. 

The discussion started with syncronisation issues in audio visual production; often the audio is referred to ‘as out of sync’ when in fact its most often that there a few frames delay from the different cameras used because there has not been enough care taken by the video editors to resynchronise the different feeds. The result of this is that as a shot changes the video latency varies while the audio is actually clocked correctly! Another problem encountered is how HD cameras output their time code which can be either in sync with their input (with latency introduced through the electronics before output) or if they sync with their output which can lead to confusion as the numbers appear correct.

The talk then turned to the loudness wars and over processing (eg multiple layers of dither) before mastering. The main problem is usually over compression and lack of headroom before being asked to master the audio because everyone is using peak as a reference level rather than working to average levels which have a lot more to do with apparent loudness.

Next up for discussion was delivery methods; where it was agreed that clients need education. Examples were presented where people had supplied .wav files which were actually rendered from .mp3’s or where the tracks had not been listened to after the final bounce before sending the tracks off. On a side note this is why I don’t want an offline bounce option in Pro Tools; I like being forced to hear the very last version of a track all the way through as this usually results in me hitting escape, making an adjustment and starting the bounce again, repeating this several times over before I’m happy to let the track play through to the end...  

--------------
The discussion on dither was also appropriate given the various algorithms surfacing in recent years, most interesting though was the discussion on compression formats where the various codecs were discussed (along with the loudness wars once more).

Ray Staff claimed he wasn’t sure whether certain lossless formats were truly lossless; though as soon as the hands shot up he stated “not FLAC though” to which most of them went back down. I mention this because I believe open standards will contribute a large way towards the future audio industry and am happy to see that the Vorbis foundation are held in high esteem in the ears of such experienced engineers. As for dynamic compression the group were concerned that things had gotten out of control due to record companies and uninformed engineers, which unfortunately is nothing new at this point and a view held by a many in the recording industry...
