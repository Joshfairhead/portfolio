Robert Fripp of King Crimson is arguably one of the most diciplined musicians out there, practicing six hours a day in order to perform near impossible arrangements like "[FracKture](https://youtu.be/W2nO_W9JZYw?si=lnfg93_qnXELxj7h)" with a triple band lineup consisting of some of the best musicians on the plannet. It's a pretty impressive [lineup](https://youtu.be/IpZxwe4SXY8?si=Qji_D0a5cH5F3uz9)! 

The band made their debut in 1969 with the album "[In the Court of The Crimson King](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_npAxahIi6ehG_i3qD04oSeSGA6iUCM58E&si=d2GbumJDXO8Ha1Dw)" which is their most famous by a long shot - you know, the one with the iconic screaming face. Apparently their first performance of "[21st Century Schitzoid Man](https://youtu.be/7OvW8Z7kiws?si=pqG-j0EtonkZI1t3)" in Hyde Park left the audience so disoriented that people forgot to clap the Rolling Stones onto stage!

For many years I found "[Red](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXhfRoiJBIislZ9MHBBNYK0h3N30Gv7Ja&si=W7AvSgRzh-hu7hmQ)" the most appealing album as it feels particularly whole and exhibits some incredible compositions. The album was titled "Red" because the band broke so many formal musical rules that if you submitted it for a music school exam you'd have received the report back full of red crosses. As suggested by such a story, the album breaks boundaries and sounds incredible having been recorded at Air Lyndhurst in London - the studio George Martin (the fifth Beatle) bought and refitted. The tracks "[One More Red Nightmare](https://youtu.be/cLoQADJnGr4?si=tVjx0lEQt_uBpH7C)" and "[Starless](https://youtu.be/bA27IWspddM?si=3hTOE3kxN0BmY1sI)" are in my opinion highlights of the album.

Another enthralling album is "[The Power to Believe](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXhfRoiJBIivyJfsjWvAqCaHEPsE986uE&si=MjXS6TjGXwvUBV7H)", which displays quite some virility. It's a modern album with electronic instruments, bone crushing guitars and some luscious moments of release. The rhythms, textures, compositions and technicality are vital elements of the resultant soundscape. You probably won't find anything like it anywhere else; incredibly creative and powerful stuff that's akin to a non-traditional gamelan.
