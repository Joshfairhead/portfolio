Kill it Kid were a pretty short lived band from Bristol with an evolution that went from bluesy folk to blisteringly hard rock over the course of three albums. Theres a clear tension of unrequited love between the vocalists that seems to build to a breaking point by the third album (they later hooked up and continued as the outfit Ida Mae).

Both singers are skilled instrumentalists; Chris Turnpin must have sold his soul to the devil to play guitar in such an authentic manner, while the keyboards have a practiced jazz influence to them (no doubt from a rock school). The rhythm section are arguably there to support the two main stars but they do a professional job, keeping things tight and stylistically appropriate. 

Each album feels pretty complete in it's own right so it's perhaps best to think of each as phases of tension, coherent in themselves and in sequence; it was consequentially quite exciting to track the bands career trajectory as it happened in real time - from folk violins to blisteringly heavy rock.

If you want to know where to start "[Feet Fall Heavy](https://youtu.be/G1IurnOsRw8?si=sNl2yPUbPBszsBg1)" exhibits the bands best writing across albums, while "[Burned in the By & By](https://youtu.be/_qo7-RWrWAE?si=lkuArnuxy3SCV_mK)" was a great Abby Road extra produced at the bands zenith yet sadly never appeared on any album. This is the dial set somewhere in the middle.
