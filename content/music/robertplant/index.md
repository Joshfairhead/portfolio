Album: [Mighty Rearranger](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWmdrxukffoAZlaeNfzur4uBfLFTKFlSz&si=CIV0giyUUpgQRIwp), [Dreamland](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lJEY-pBUUaZqugz6WuN4ZwhVulKh_mToQ&si=2onjwn5Yy37ASd9K)

While a lot of Robert Plants solo work doesn't really float my boat, Mighty Rearranger is absolutely fantastic! "[Another Tribe](https://youtu.be/Ry1LfNdfRt8?si=Pkumgyzvs4P45Vln)" starts the album with a rhythmic vitality that beams sunshine everywhere, which is appropriate given the second track is called "[Shine It All Around](https://youtu.be/3qp9z3IA_fU?si=fFtsvYOdLpWrTMvY)". This track is another winner on the production given it's many layred vocals and huge echo effects on the chorus - hard to believe it was recoded in a small Welsh studio. At the end of the album there's also a drum and bass remix of this tune which is pretty nice. Roberts not lost his voice or soul even at this stage of his career. 

Honourable mentions as well to the album Dreamland which is also pretty strong; particularly "Darkness, Darkness" and his cover of Dylan's "[One More Cup Of Coffee](https://youtu.be/SWUUR_BEG6o?si=wRxT3-S6w8tm_mNX)". Of course we could add a lot of the Zeppelin stuff here as well but I'm deliberately avoiding review of obvious classics as those trails are known.
