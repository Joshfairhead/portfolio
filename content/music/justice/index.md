With dark but colourful aesthetic, the albums Woman and Woman World Wide (its live remix) are a hyperoptimised synthesis of synthesis... oscillating with an impressivly polished sound, the dark saw tooth synths and side chained snares are skillfully blendend with airy pop melodies that seem lush and spacious to the ear. 

The production is attentive and detailed; if you tune into the warm embrace of the track "[Love SOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uOjxYYhE7I)" you'll notice a tuned siren which follows the chord progression with a washing white noise generator that laps gently like waves splashing in the background! Everything on this album has a similarly distinct texture which will appeal to folks with a wide musical palette. Oh, and what a [spectacle their shows are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MucREx-e4Q&t=380s)!
