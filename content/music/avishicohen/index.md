Album: [Continuo](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoxhDWWBCgefXsfrPmbktRpAmreYVgOGy&si=HvnSikRTuue3_zgg)

Double bass, drums and piano is all you need as an Israeli jazz trio. The drum and bass rhythm section gel particularly together but the keys are still a very nice touch that couldn't be done without. 

The album [Continuo](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoxhDWWBCgefXsfrPmbktRpAmreYVgOGy&si=HvnSikRTuue3_zgg) is a graceful journey through what feels like a desert, through many a figurative "[emotional storm](https://youtu.be/JURBuEQA1sM?si=Td5egJlLLcoXICMt)". It has a breadth, depth and a vastness that I've not heard on many other albums and it feels extremely authentic and honest in its underlying nature.
