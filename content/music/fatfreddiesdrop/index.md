Albums: [BOATS](https://youtu.be/Y7QQS5V3cnI?si=tzg0r2g2A2Ei2PeQ), [Blackbird](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn7qZ70jqTZEF3chAUjrlduLDuSFuUoBC&si=1MoTXgHRbB2r0pLL).

Funky, dubby, souly, psychedelic goodness from Wellington New Zealand. For those literate enough to read the songlines, there are landscapes packed into BOATS thats brimming with meaning and significance assuming you can feel the soul. The bands first album "Based on a True Story" (aka BOATS) with its acrostically evocative album cover is probably the bands most popular work, although Blackbird has a sense of ratna earthyness that shouldn't be ignored.

The production of both albums are top notch; high quality recordings, strong arrangements, soulful vocals, nuanced and expressive lyrics - vibes all round. 
If you ask me, pretty much all all the tracks on BOATS are strong, though if you'd like something to illustrate my earlier claims then "[Ray Ray](https://youtu.be/Y7QQS5V3cnI?si=NGUgkX9-d5a7TUmR&t=1164)" is a good track to try on for size with it's muted bass lines, sharply polished lazer beam SFX and smooth vocals. For those that enjoy contrast, the pimped out producion of Ray Ray eases off the gas by moving into "[Dark Days](https://youtu.be/Y7QQS5V3cnI?si=fAwHuTLetLywAgfJ&t=1626)" which tastes more organic, dynamic and emotive. Let the acoustic, horns, crash and brushed snare sweep you into the ebb and flow of a three four waltz; for me this song really embodies the heart of the psychedelic experience and what it means to be human. 

[Blackbird](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn7qZ70jqTZEF3chAUjrlduLDuSFuUoBC&si=1MoTXgHRbB2r0pLL) is a different vibe; still distinctly the Drop but the music has a different feel thats murkier and perhaps more magic mushrooms than LSD. The tracks have a looser and more lumpy quality than the ones found on BOATS. The standout track for me on this album is "[Mother Mother](https://youtu.be/ZyD0NlsZDac?si=NedEo7_sNn6boCy5)" due to its exceptionally smooth transition from acoustic band into a more synthy electro pulse before fade out.
