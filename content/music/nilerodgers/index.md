Albums: [Risque](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPunBhufk07IAKw1a60mDa8pj6gPAsTBw&si=p0X8n3dv5ngSTJct), [Random Access Memories](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSbDLF8wQ3oKcstd9ybCSv2lNm_8NTYkI&si=p-CHt2IbHd05__YT),

Nile has always churned out hits since the early days of Chic's "[Everybody Dance](https://youtu.be/aKmJxpKKvYM?si=U3PkVPlMXhFhedi9)", through to Daft Punks "[Get Lucky](https://youtu.be/5NV6Rdv1a3I?si=vIVs58KmrMu0NhWv)". What's most amazing about him is his ability to take complex jazz voicings and create a polished pop masterpiece without a hint of dissonance. Check out his interviews, he's a wonderful story teller and is living proof that Disco doesn't suck (though he was somewhat forced into new territories by the movement).

Myself, I'm a fan of the Chic classics like "[Everybody Dance](https://youtu.be/aKmJxpKKvYM?si=U3PkVPlMXhFhedi9)" and "[Good times](https://youtu.be/51r5f5OdIY0?si=566_u2U1b3ZR3DOc)" for the uplifting funk vibes and genere defining style of guitar and bass leading the rhythm section; Bernard Edwards being Niles legendary compatriot on the low end. Absolutely Rocking. 

Besides Chic's tunes, Nile is pretty much all over the map when it comes to major artists; Madonna, Sister Sledge, Bowie, Duran Duran and so on - though Daft Punk's last album is for me the most interesting. Of course "[Get Lucky](https://youtu.be/5NV6Rdv1a3I?si=vIVs58KmrMu0NhWv)" with Pharell Williams was the big splash but "[Give Life Back to Music](https://youtu.be/IluRBvnYMoY?si=WfbACqeryuNHNoyw)" and "[Loose Yourself to Dance](https://youtu.be/NF-kLy44Hls?si=CBPXIwoYEjRAphT9)" are arguably better pieces of craft.
