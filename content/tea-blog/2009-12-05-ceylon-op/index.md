This tea doesn't really have a whole lot to it... There is an intial taste which is rather solid but has no proper substance to it at the same time. The after taste disappears almost instantly but all in all for the price is rather ok. That said I would rather drink something different for day to day drinking (but Celyons are usually my least favorite tea anyway)
