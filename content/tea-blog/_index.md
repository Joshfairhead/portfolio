An archive of my tea blog from London, featuring tasting notes and reviews of various teas from Whittards, Fortnum & Mason, Terra Nera Tea Boutique, and other fine tea retailers.

Reviews span from December 2009 to September 2011, covering Assam, Darjeeling, Ceylon, blends, and flavored teas. Each review includes ratings based on price and overall taste.
