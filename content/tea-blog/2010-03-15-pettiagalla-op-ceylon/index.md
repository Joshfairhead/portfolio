This is some bloody good tea...
It tastes very fruity in a good way, although orange in the title is a reference to dutch royalty rather than the taste; however it seems to actually have a really subtle background taste of orange in it. Its similar to a typical darjeeling with its texture but has a bit more body. Some what of a medium weight tea and a new favorite for the moment.
