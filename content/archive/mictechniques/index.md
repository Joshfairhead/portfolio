TODO: Add gallery of different placements

Sometimes its nice to take a trip to the studio without any serious time constraints just try things out and see how different recording scenarios work out in terms of microphone choice and placement. 

# Drum Placement
With drums usually being one of the first instruments to get recorded and arguably one of the more complex instruments we deal with (on a regular basis) it was thought best to start experimenting with the different ways to approach them. Note that before any recording can take place its a good idea to find the best spot in the room which is usually found through the <a href="http://www.mixingwithyourmind.com/">Stavrou method</a> (p55); beating the floor tom while moving around the room and listening for a spot where the kit sounds good (the rationale being that it’s the drum with the deepest resonance and so problematic room modes become easily identifiable).

# Overheads
From both reading and experience, these are what I consider to be the most important microphones on the whole kit. They are essentially a foundation on which the rest of the drum sound can be built and so its important to check how each additional microphone on a multi-miked kit interacts with them upon placement. 

In this experiment several spaced pairs of omni directional microphones measured to be equal distance from the kick drum were tested against each other (practically in the same spot). On test were pairs of <a href="http://www.dpamicrophones.com/en/mic-guide.aspx?c=Item&amp;item=24065#diagrams" target="_blank">DPA 4090s</a>, <a href="http://www.dpamicrophones.com/en/mic-guide.aspx?c=Item&amp;item=24010#diagrams" target="_blank">DPA 4006s</a>, <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/frequency-graphs.php/0350" target="_blank">Earthworx QTC1s</a> and <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/frequency-graphs.php/0861" target="_blank">Neumann U87s</a>. There was also a mid-side setup of <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/microphones/AKG-Acoustics/C-414-B-XLS" target="_blank">AKG C414</a>s as room ambience and a few spot microphones. To my ears the best spaced pair was were the <a href="http://www.dpamicrophones.com/en/mic-guide.aspx?c=Item&amp;item=24065#diagrams" target="_blank">DPA 4090s</a> which captured just about everything exceptionally well along with a really nice stereo image; the kick was solid and DPAs picked up a very usable snare/tom sound along with the cymbals sounding particularly clear. I would put the <a href="http://www.dpamicrophones.com/en/mic-guide.aspx?c=Item&amp;item=24010#diagrams" target="_blank">DPA 4006s</a> in second place as they had very similar qualities to the <a href="http://www.dpamicrophones.com/en/mic-guide.aspx?c=Item&amp;item=24065#diagrams">4090s</a>, though sounded a little dead in comparison especially on the toms/kick.

The Earthworks <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/frequency-graphs.php/0350" target="_blank">QTC1</a>'s captured really natural sounding toms with plenty of resonance and a crystal clear ride but in comparison to the DPAs their stereo image seemed a little narrow and sloppy, over all sounding less defined. Lastly were the <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/frequency-graphs.php/0861" target="_blank">Neumann U87</a>s which sounded captured a broader spectrum and had a ‘larger’ sound but sounded a little low in terms of fidelity when compared with the other microphones on test (although they had a better image than the <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/frequency-graphs.php/0350" target="_blank">QTC1</a>s). I suspect the U87s on test might have been a bit abused from years of student use which may account for their somewhat lackluster performance, though the DPA’s are certainly quality microphones that were still leaps and bounds ahead of them...

After these microphones were tested the <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/frequency-graphs.php/0350" target="_blank">QTC1</a>s were left up (as reference) and a mid-side pair of <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/microphones/AKG-Acoustics/C-414-B-XLS" target="_blank">AKG C414</a>s was put up above the kit; although I like MS pairs on a lot of things this was not a set up I would repeat as primary overheads although it could be useful for augmenting a kits sound. However I would assume this probably introduces more phase problems than its worth and would most likely avoid using MS in preference of a well placed pair of spaced omni directionals.

The next experiment was the placement of spot microphones for cymbals for which the <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/frequency-graphs.php/0350" target="_blank">Earthworx</a> were used along with MS <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/microphones/AKG-Acoustics/C-414-B-XLS" target="_blank">C414</a>s as ambience for reference. Three placements were tried; 30cm above the cymbals pointing vertically downwards, 20cm away tilted 45° from vertical and then 20cm away pointing about 80° from vertical. The first placement seemed a little distant and slightly dull but this brightened up in the second position and gained some definition while in the third position the sound was so brittle it was pretty unusable (which was kind of expected). In short getting closer added high end and getting further off axis from the top of the cymbal captured what sounds like odd order harmonics (a slightly courser sound).

# Room
The next tes was a Jecklin Disk (<a href="http://www.dpamicrophones.com/en/mic-guide.aspx?c=Item&amp;item=24065#diagrams" target="_blank">DPA 4090s</a>) placed to capture the drums ambience the same distance as a MS pair of <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/microphones/AKG-Acoustics/C-414-B-XLS" target="_blank">AKG C414</a>s. The Jecklin on its own didn’t sound great but picked up the toms resonating quite well although the kick was by no means prominent. The MS pair on their own sounded natural enough with the added benefit of being ‘three channel stereo’ which is extremely flexible; I find these channels in particular great for building upon with reverb in order to increase the perceived room size or to just fill out the drum sound without compromising the definition of the close microphones. Despite the MS/Jecklin working together alright, I see little point in ever using the disk again once the kit has overheads backed up with the MS pair and spot microphones as another set of stereo microphones would/could just add to potential phase problems.

# Snare
The college mikes (and a few from various other sources) were tested on both a wooden and metal bodied snare. The placement was not extremely precise as an over all characteristic sound can be heard from the different microphones easily enough and will invariably need some adjustment depending on the room/kit. Various spot microphones were auditioned on the top, side and bottom of the snare; while overheads and ambience mikes were recorded at the same time to place the spot mikes in a realistic context. A few hits, rolls and the whole kit being played was recorded; swapping the snare for another after this to hear the difference. After this the microphones were swapped and the process repeated.

I have never been particularly pleased with the characteristics of a <a href="http://shurenotes.com/issue42/images/Article-2_02.gif" target="_blank">Sure SM57</a> on the top, previously settling for a <a href="http://www.creativevideo.co.uk/images/products/altimage/01%2007%202007sennheiser_md-421_freq.jpg" target="_blank">Sennheiser MD421</a> as a useable option. I've been curious to try a <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/microphones/AKG-Acoustics/C-414-B-XLS" target="_blank">AKG C414</a> on the top snare and had the chance in these experiments which was probably the best mic of the selection and captured a solid midrange body with a good snap at higher frequencies. Other microphones tested were the standard <a href="http://shurenotes.com/issue42/images/Article-2_02.gif" target="_blank">SM57</a> and <a href="http://www.creativevideo.co.uk/images/products/altimage/01%2007%202007sennheiser_md-421_freq.jpg" target="_blank">MD421</a> alongside a collection of other microphones such as the <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/frequency-graphs.php/0861" target="_blank">Neumann U87</a> or <a href="http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:uhTdPDyXI9QJ:www.audio-technica.com/cms/resource_library/literature/87ca2d22dba3ad06/index.html/+XLRM+AT4050ST&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESheaqZFfucWX9qhB3XkN3wph9GizGGu-lg-H5y4CEpiye8mBofZefz6o1C8aqIVuzzTIJObBstkMRWwsY671M4vvers1ryKLOcLPrhkPSb6EUOa9GQ5znpU1_sb7w-8T3ON-egz&amp;sig=AHIEtbQZ20hb6WNVl3wN4S6hqL55pT_gwg" target="_blank">Audio Technica AT4047</a>.

Placing a microphone on the side of the snare rather than the bottom sounded better every time, capturing a softer and more evenly distributed high end than the course rattly sound most bottom mikes seem to pick up. Placed about 4-5 inches from the body (and away from the pressure displacement holes) the sound captured from a side mic takes on a much more pleasant 'pffftt' characteristic than a phase inverted bottom mic which mostly just captured a harsh 'kkkKK' sound. Another advantage to the side microphone is utilising a figure of eight polar pattern to cancel out some kick or hi-hat spill with the microphones 'deaf spots'. The two best choices for the side mike was the <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/microphones/AKG-Acoustics/C-414-B-XLS" target="_blank">C414</a> and surprisingly the <a href="http://www.akg.com/picture.php?txt=For%20image%20download%3A%20right%20click%20image%2C%20click%20%22Save%20Picture%20%28Image%29%20As%22%2C%20click%20%22Save%22.&amp;pic=/mediendatenbank2/pspic/hires//31/c1000s_car4055c29587f20.jpg" target="_blank">AKG C1000</a>s which are good for capturing a dulled sound (probably from masking due to a drop in response around 7k after a boost at ). The choice of large or small diaphragm capsules are pretty arbitrary but encompass completely different sounds which is handy for shaping the drums tone; typically though the small diaphragms sounded more focused with a lot more high end while large diaphragms had a more balanced spectrum

The bottom microphones in this experiment were beaten hands down every time by the side snare mic; there were some useable options amongst the mikes but nothing that sounded particularly great. A <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/microphones/AKG-Acoustics/C-414-B-XLS" target="_blank">C414</a> was again the best mic for the job but the various dynamic mikes available were pretty close to it.

Microphones tested on top snare:
Audio Technica AT4047 - Perhaps the best of the everything tested though perhaps not as adaptable to any situation as the <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/microphones/AKG-Acoustics/C-414-B-XLS" target="_blank">C414</a> and had a bit less weight.
<a href="http://recordinghacks.com/microphones/AKG-Acoustics/C-414-B-XLS" target="_blank"> AKG C414</a> - The safest of all choices working well for both snares while it would probably be fitting to most genres
<a href="http://www.akg.com/picture.php?txt=For%20image%20download%3A%20right%20click%20image%2C%20click%20%22Save%20Picture%20%28Image%29%20As%22%2C%20click%20%22Save%22.&amp;pic=/mediendatenbank2/pspic/hires//31/c1000s_car4055c29587f20.jpg" target="_blank"> AKG C1000</a> - More life than the dynamics below but its still a poor mans <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/microphones/AKG-Acoustics/C-414-B-XLS" target="_blank">C414</a>
<a href="http://shurenotes.com/issue42/images/Article-2_02.gif" target="_blank"> Sure Sm57</a> - Safe choice on the wooden Tama snare, but perhaps too much low end on the metal body while sounding a bit average overall.
Sure SM58 - Not so nice as the SM57 on the Tama, but safer on the metal snare.
<a href="http://recordinghacks.com/frequency-graphs.php/0861" target="_blank"> Neumann U87</a> - Awful on the Tama and only slightly better on the metal snare.

Microphones tested on the side:
Audio Technica AT4047 - Nice smooth laid back sound to it that works nicely
<a href="http://recordinghacks.com/microphones/AKG-Acoustics/C-414-B-XLS" target="_blank"> AKG C414</a> - Pretty good with a bit more body that the AT4047
<a href="http://www.akg.com/picture.php?txt=For%20image%20download%3A%20right%20click%20image%2C%20click%20%22Save%20Picture%20%28Image%29%20As%22%2C%20click%20%22Save%22.&amp;pic=/mediendatenbank2/pspic/hires//31/c1000s_car4055c29587f20.jpg" target="_blank"> AKG C1000</a> - Really good for a smooth dull sound
<a href="http://recordinghacks.com/frequency-graphs.php/0861" target="_blank"> Neumann U87</a> - Maybe it could work on a heavily deadened snare, though I would still most likely pick another mic.
Studio Electronics SE Z3300a - Brighter than the u87, so much so that it hurts your ears.
AKG C480b (ck61-uls capsule) - Similar to the Z3300a but with frequencies concentrated slightly higher.
<a href="http://shurenotes.com/issue42/images/Article-2_02.gif" target="_blank"> Sure SM57</a> - Only put up on the side out of curiosity but would make a nice lo-fi snare suitable for electronic styles of music.

Overheads

These are what I consider to be the most important microphones on the kit. They are essentially the foundation from which a drum sound can be built and so its important to check how each additional microphone interacts with them on placement; filling holes is a lot easier against an clear image...

In this experiment several spaced pairs measured to be equal distance from the kick drum were tested. On test were pairs of DPA 4090s, DPA 4006s, Earthworx QTC1s and Neumann U87s. There was also a mid-side setup of AKG C414s as room ambience and a few spot microphones.

To my ears the best spaced pair was with the DPA 4090s which captured just about everything with a really nice stereo image; the kick was solid and they contained a very usable snare/tom sound along with the cymbals sounding particularly clear. In second place I would put the DPA 4006s which had very similar qualities to the 4090s but sounded a little dead in comparison especially on the toms/kick. 

The Earthworks QTC1s captured really natural sounding toms and a crystal clear ride but in comparison to the DPAs their stereo image seems a little narrow and a bit less defined. Lastly were the Neumann U87s; these sounded fine but a little lo-fi in comparison to the other microphones although they had a better image than the QTC1s but carried a bit more weight.

After these microphones were tested the QTC1s were left up (as reference) and a mid-side pair of AKG C414s was put up above the kit; although I like MS pairs on a lot of things this was not a set up I would repeat as primary overheads although it could be useful for augmenting a kits sound. However I would assume this probably introduces more phase problems than its worth and would most likely avoid using MS in preference of a well placed pair of spaced omnis.

The next experiment was the placing of spot microphones on cymbals using the earthworks (along with MS AKGs as ambience for reference). Three placements were tried; 30cm above the cymbals pointing vertically downwards, 20cm away tilted 45° from vertical and then 20cm away pointing about 80° from vertical. The first placement seemed a little distant and slightly dull, this brightened up in the second position and gained some definition while in the third position the sound was so brittle it was pretty unusable (as expected). 

Mics used:
DPA 4090
DPA 4006
Earthworx QTC1
Neumann U87

Room
The next experiment was a Jecklin Disk (DPA 4090s) placed to capture the drums ambience the same distance as a MS pair of AKG C414s. The Jecklin on its own didn’t sound great but picked up the toms resonating quite well and although the kick was by no means prominent when added to the MS pair it made a positive reinforcement. 

The mid-side on its own captured a pretty good kick/snare along with having the advantage of being quite versatile (three channel stereo); however it can quite easily sound a bit loose though this is somewhat to be expected of a room ambience...
