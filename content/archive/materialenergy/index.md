We can also probably set fire to the haystack of 'over unity' energy by systematically examining various claims with Bennetts methodology against the schema provided. 

One claim that comes to mind is that "energy is pertubations in a field modality" which consists of "capacity, resistance, magnetic permeability and dielectric permeativitty".

Referring to Antony Hodgsons book on Cosmic Ecology, which describes and relates various worldviews, I'm starting to concieve of myself and others as an extremely rich set of complex particles. Analogously, Holonic recursion or the Hermetic aphorism 'as above, so below', would suggest that this is probably the case as well.

I say this because in my 'over unity' energy investigations, I've encountered a number of theories and in this territory the question of 'how we know' becomes important. Retroductivly speaking, I can say that certain things are true from experience and so they are probably true by analogy on levels below or above the scale of humans or the class of 'vital' energies.

For one thing, what is energy? While no physicist or mathematician, I can understand that it's a field perturbation at different levels of abstraction. What is a field? well it seems that fields are substrates made up of various sources, which is true from personal experience.

At the level of electrical fields, I've heard the definition to be a tetrad to be: capacity, resistance, magnetic permeability and dielectric permeativitty; research is needed to further confirm this but it feels about right analogously based on experience.
