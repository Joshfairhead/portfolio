After borrowing my housemates Beyerdynamic DT990's and A/B testing them with my own Sennheiser HD595‘s, I've come to the conclusion that their both equally good for different reasons. 

The main difference between them is in the bass response; the Beyer's have a slightly exaggerated low end thats ridiculously tight, while the Sennheisers have a more natural low end thats a bit bass light closer approximating the low frequency cancelation of play back over speakers in a room. Being nearly polar opposites this pair worked great in combination; I could pinpoint problematic low frequencies with the Beyer's while getting a good idea of what something would sound like over speakers with the Sennheisers.

Due to the bass response difference the pair sound quite different from each other but I would argue that the midrange and high end are fairly similar; its just that they are perceived differently from the low frequency masking. That said it must be noted that they Beyer's are slightly more focused and as my housemate confirms this makes them exceptional for editing.

The Sennheisers are excellent and I couldn't imagine replacing them; however I would love a pair of the Beyer's as a secondary pair of headphones for backup and another perspective...
