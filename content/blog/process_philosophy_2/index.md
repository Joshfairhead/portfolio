What does whiteheads philosophy organism contribute to understanding how it is that we live in a physical universe that gives rise to organisms here on earth and perhaps many other planets thought the galaxy and even the cosmos? 

The nature of this question has shifted over the last several centuaries, primal indeginous cultures have considered the earth to be alive and death to be the mystery. From the modern scientific cultures, particularly those posessesed by the mechanical point of view, the universe was considered to be a dead collection of material particals and the real mystery was the question what is life? An inquiry of rather urgent concern, because in an other wise mechanistic universe the emergence of living organisms and indeed conscious being such as ourselves didnt make much sense. Living conscious beings seemed to be an an anomaly in the mechanistic universe. The answer to the question from this perspetive is seen to be rather bleak, with life as an improbable accident of order and organisation thats clinging precariously to a fundementally dead rock. 

Whitehead is inhereting a speculative tradition that goes back to the origins in ancient greece that speculated on the world soul and animus mundi that brought life into the organisation of life down from the grandest scale down to the microcosmic scale of our existence here on earth. Not because life appears as such an anomaly but because physics itself was moving beyond this mechanistic conception, causing Whitehead to rethink the materialistic mechanistic background that led us to imagine life as some form of afterthought, as some kind of late emerging curiosity of an otherwise mechanical world. Instead his philosophy of organism invites us to consider life as an integral feature of this universe, woven into the very texture of cosmogenesis. So life is not a foreigner or anomaly, its the universe coming to know itself ever more deeply so as to become more conscious. 

From whiteheads point of view, scientific materialism was proving itself inadequite for accounting for the emergence of life but even for our understanding of what matter and energy are. Whitehead really allows us to question this idea that reality or the universe is nothing but purposeless matter colliding in the void. Which again would lead us to thinking about life and mind as just anomalies or at worst illusions even. By reduching organisms to mechanisms materialism ends up sawing off the very branch upon which science itself rests. We asked the question how is natural science possible, and can circle back a bit, for value and experience and purpose to be dismissed as unreal then the scientists own persuit of truth which is the value they are persuing, they value the truth, then the whole enterprise is undermined. So organisms engaging in the enterprise are themselves, that that consciousness and agency is just an illusion reducible to particles in empty space meaninglessly and purposslessly, so again this question of the place of life in the cosmos is not disconnected from the question of how is science possible. 

So to understand properly the place of life we need to reimagine our whole cosmology. Organism must replace mechanism as the core metaphor of natural science. Similarly feeling or "prehension" in Whiteheads technical terms, prehension must replace blind collision, which was how the mechanistic universe were thought to relate to eachother. Prehension in Whiteheads cosmology is granted primacy in our account of causal relations, as part of a movement to give life its proper due in a now living universe. 

For Whitehead, every actual occasion and every atomic and animal occasion, is a locus of feeling. It's a moment of experience that involves inhereting the past and anticipating the future, the degree depth duration and intensity of feeling depends on the complexity of the social organisation witin which that actual occasion is arising. Its not that atoms are as conscious as animals but there is a moducum of experience, in Whiteheads view. He is generalising life beyond biology, hes rooting life in the very fabric of existence, this is his pan experientialism. To exist is to feel however dim or simply. Life in its biological form then in terms of living cells and multi cellular plants and animals is but a high achievement of this universal capacity for relation, the cosmos cant be understood unaesthetically, it is an aesthetic process. All levels of organisation in the universe are artistic achievements, you could say articstic expressions. For whitehead the purpose of the universe and evolution is to achieve beauty, in ever richer and more complex forms of beauty. Its not a universe of mechanisms obeying fixed laws but an organism, a cosmic organism, thats lured by beauty. The teleology of the universe is directed to the production of beauty. 

In my book, Maturana and Varella are quoted. To dismiss love, which is an example of the aesthetic lure of the universe. An erotic drive that underlies the evolutionary process. To dismiss love would be to turn our back on a biological history thats more than 3.5 billion years old. Whitehead would extend this claim, Love or what he calls divine eros is not just the basis of social life, not just the basis of the biological world, but the very pulse of cosmogenesis itself. 

So when whitehead speaks of divine eros driving the evolutionary process towards the emergence of biological life out of a simpler form of what we could call physical life. THis is not a foreign deity that stands above the world and commands it from without, his understanding is an immanent lure thats woven into each occasions experience as a call towards greater intensity of experience and harmony with outer occasions and deeper beauty. God is not a cosmic engineer as the engineer was imagined by the first generation of scientists but the poet of possiblity that shares in the worlds risks as a fellow sufferer who understands and a fellow enjoyer, so the divine evolves with the world and enters into ever deeper relationships as biological organisms become capable of sustaining of that original divine impulse. 

So then what is the place of life in the cosmos? For whitehead, Life is not the exception but the rule, life becomes the very basis of creative process in the universe. Its not an epiphenomenan, life is really part of a grammar of existence, the cosmos being a living self making work of art. Life is houw we understand the nature of the universe as an experiment in an effort to flourish, drawing new beauty from the depths of possibility. To study life is not simply to analyse dna or catelogue species, but to learn how the universe itself is striving to enhance and deepen its experience. Its about seeing how each being, each actual occasions of experience, each moment in the life history of a living cell or plant or animal or a human being, how it inherets the deep evolutionary past billions of years in the making and anticipates novel futures and allows us to understand the evolutionary process as one when were love or eros is infused even into the smallest particle or molecule and that the urge of creation is also an urge to relate. 

So against this modern bifurcation of matter and mind, whitehead is envisioning a participatory cosmos, the place of life in the universe in short is everywhere, the cosmos itself is alive its an adventure of feeling, striving for richer beauty. To be alive is not to stand apart from a dead material universe but to be the universe itself in its most intimate acts of self enjoyment.
