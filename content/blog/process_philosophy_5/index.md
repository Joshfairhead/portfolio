This lecture is a conversation with Ed Kelly as a guest, coming from university of virginia, department of perceptual studies. The discussion focuses on non-local or immaterial phenemena like 'Psi', which honestly seemed better addressed in documentaires like the Telepahty Tapes, and while such miraculous phenemena are very much my area of interest I found this conversation a bit fragmented and a yawn.  

In terms of Whitehead they cover old ground of actual entities as having a physical and mental dipole, and that this is held together through prehension. I suppose when you get into non-locality and psi, prehension is a pretty good term. The most salient aspect of the discussion for me was the mention of 'eternal objects' and 'potenti', the former being along the lines of platonic forms, the latter being less platonic, so probably closer to Wolframs hypergraphs or something like that.

A lecture by Matt is presented after this conversation which...


Matt on Schelling instead of Whitehead, I think of Schelling as one of the first Panethesiests, but this idea of an evolutionary process or time developmental universe seems to be rather new with Schelling before maybe Herder or Lessing, who were just beginning to think of an evolutionary universe. Panenthesism preceeded Schelling, but he was probably one of the first to ealiests exemplars of evolutionary panenthesim. 

To understand schelling you have to start with Kants copernician revolution. This will help us undersand what whas so creative about what schelling was doing, and its important to understand what whitehead was doing - even though Whitehead in the preface to process and reality said it was a recursion to pre kantian modes thought, because he thought there were major wrong turns with Kant, none the less he goes on to refer to kant a bunch and ends up inverting kant in an interesting way that i think was prefigured by schelling. 

I dont thkink that whitehead was reading a bunch of schelling but he cites him once in the concept of nature. One last thing Ill say about whitehead right now, is that in science of the modern world I think he gets german idealism wrong, because he says that its unfortunate that as generative as it was philosophically it was out of touch with modern science. Which you cant say about schelling or goethe, they were deeply immersed in the cutting edge sciences of their time; the study of electricity and magnetism, biology embryology. Not only were they studying what science was discovering but schelling and goethe contributed to science. The german physisist Horstead in developing electromagnetism and faraday later were influenced by schellings understandnig of the polarities at work in the natural world. SO whitehead got his history a little wrong here. 

Lets go back to Kant, in his critique of pure reason 1871 he says in the introduction to limit our knowledge of nature to leave room for faith. Theres this kantian moment, which has continued to be so influential for hundreds of years afterwards that I think has a lot to do with the problems of psi research being put on oneside and not being considered to be part of our study of natuer and natural phenemenoa, because kant was actually very interested in swinborg, and his claims towards clairvoyence, precognition and all these things and kant wanted to evaluate all that. it was one of the triggers in addition to David Hume that awoke him from his dogmatic slumber and it was also swinbogrs claims about disembodied entities still seeming to have bodies and exist in space and time that made kant realise he needed to put all that aside and elaborate a new approach to understanding natural phenemnoa that would rule out things that newtonian physics couldnt account for. while at the same time for Kant there was this other realm, this noumenal realm where we were at least justified in believing in the afterlife, freedom and so on.

But what kant does in his critique of pure reason is to ask, what must our mind be like or our cognition be structured for nature to appear to us in a lowfully ordered way. And so he was a student of newtons physics, did a bit of astromy himself, where had this universal theory of the heavens, where he developes the kant laplace nebular hypothesis, because kant was the first one to imagine how our solarsystem formed by gravitation alone, so the plasma physisists might have some issues. But none the less he was enamoured with newtonian physics but he realised that if this was true of all of nature and the human being, at least in our embodied physical form, as part of nature then theres no room left for our freedom - so Kant wanted to be able to justify this efficient causal understanding of nature but also wanted to leave room for our human freedom. So he ends up with this compromised position, sometimes I call this the human interval because its unstable, so kants asking us to live in these two worlds. The moral world order on the onehand where he says for look for human life to be meaningful, civilisation and morality to be meaningful, we have to assume we are free. The moral world is totally invisable to science, we cant observe it or measure it but we assume it because we are free beings, if we wernt all of morality goes out the window. On the otherhand we have natural science which gives us a pciture of the universe bane seemingly deterministic mechanical laws, and the way he allows these to hang together is by saying that well natural science is studying the apparent world, the world of phenemena, and what religion has been dealing wit his this invisible world this noumenal world, we cant know anything about this world but we are justified in beliieving it exists. I had to limit knowledge to leave room for faith and freedom primarily.

Kant seemed pretty satisfied with this position, absolutely nobody understood it when he published the critique of pure reason. It took about a generation but he was all the rage and wrote two more critiques, the critique of practical reason (freedom as a postualate where he unpacks his moral theory), 1790 the critique of judgement where hes dealing with aesthetics and our perception of beauty, and hes also dealing with organisms and exploring teleological judgement, judgement- of purpositiveness. He would sat there is a form of teleology at work in human artistic expression. The artist has an end in mind and try to express that in their artworks. He saw this teleology in the living world, and relaised there is a crack in the firewall hed errected in the noumenal world of freedom on onehand and the phenemonal world of nature obeying mechanical laws on the other, and that crakc is the organism. Kant realisted that the mechanical laws which apply in everyting else in nature dont apply to organisms, and coins the term self organisation because their cause and effect are circular, this isnt efficient cause anymore like newtonian physics. Organisms are purposive, as if kant said that when we look at even a mere blade of grass the freedom and self organisation of our own rational capacities, our own autonomy as free beings reflected back to us as if in a mirror. So he was seeing reason, which is supposed to be in the human mind, in the living world operationg in this loopy form of causality. 

Where kant goes with this realisation is to say that biology cant be a science because its not mechanistic, and when we see self organisation in the living world what we are doing is projecting our own rational capacities and freedom on to that. We can use that as a heuristic, as if organisms had this other form of causality that made them agents in their own right, just like we are moral agents but thats not what nature is really doing or at least we cant know if thats what nature is really doing. As a result of this biology can only ever be a descriptive science, unlike physics which can explanitory. Even though for kant physics is only explaing the phenemenol world, theres also a noominal world for kant where god, immortality and freedom and so on could exist and we are justified in believing this because in principal science just cant reach this world. The kantian interval.

Most human beings want there to be some connection between spiritual reality and their everyday lives, and want to be able to do science of, well biology first of all. But also psychology, understand our own psyches, things like the afterlife, all of this psi phenemena that kant just coordined off in this uncomfortable realm. 

In the wake of kants critiques, in his so called trancendental philosophy, there are a number of responses, the first came from, yoan gotlard figda, who wanted to further radicalise kant and kant initially quite liked what vigda was doing, but for vigda, kant left a residue of dogmatism in his philosophy, where theres a point in the critique of pure reason where kant says I'm not a kinda a kinda darkly idealist who thinks theres not a real world out there. That noumenal word which he marks with an X definately exists and we can think it, we just cant know anything about it. And he even goes as far as to say that the noumenal world is the cause of our sensations, sensitive experience. 

The problem with that is that kant had already said and spent hundreds of pages elaborating that causation is a category of our own understanding, but now hes saying that that the world beyond our experience is causing our experience. So hes applying a category beyond apperences in order to account for experiences, which Vigda sees and then radicalises by saying that the whole world, phemenal noumenal is brought forth by our own minds and thinking activity. This might sound like solopsism but I dont think this is a fair characterisation of figda. When he talks about the I, the first preson pronoun, he talks of something thats present beyond each of us that our emperical ego or everyday consciousness presupposes or that I dont have anymore than you posess this trancendental I that figda was talking about, that the whole universe pours out of. Its not that different from a Advita position and indeed these guys were the Slagel brothers, who were part of this circle of friends in Gaiena who were translating the agada gad vida, so there was this influx of asian philosophy and spirituality, so its no suprise that Vigda would go in this direction.

Schelling now, he was a student of Vigdas in the late 1790s, where at 19/20 years old he started publishing articles in response to vigda, and initially was quite impressed by what vigda was doing to further radicalise kant, to make kant even more trancendental than even kant realised. As they put then, look we are following the spirit of kant even though the letter of kant was more conservitive, and kant lived long enough to see what they were doing and got uncompfotable with it. 

But schelling had also grown up in this context, of swabbian pietism, and this mysticism that thought there was tihs connection between nature and the spirity world. And so vigda was so intensly emphasising the mind pole of this mind nature polarity that schelling became a bit uncomfortable and thought that nature was not being done justice by Vigdas approach, nature was just the not I. Which in vigdas view, nature is just posited by the I, by the activity of the I so that nature can reflect upon itself and meet some resistance so as to become self conscious. But in that sense nature is nothing more than the opportunity for mind to become conscious of itself, it has no autonomous independent reality for Vigda. Its even more of a mere appearence than kant had it in his trancendental philosophy.

So schelling what he does is that he realises, wait a minuite I need to invert this whole kantian picture that Vigda has radicalises, because if it leads to where vigda ends up that cant possibly be right because we konw nature is out there and autonomous from schellings point of view, the body of the divine and revelation of the deity. 

If kants basic question is copernician revolution philosophy, which he analogises with what Copernicous did in astrology, where he said its not the sky thats moving its the earth thats moving. Kant did something analogous by saying cognition is not about our mind conforming to the objects out there, for kant its the reverse, objects need to conform to how our minds are structured. So kants asking **what must the mind be so that nature can appear to it in the way it does?**.

Schelling says no no no, we need to reverse this, its not mind and its categories and its forms of intuition that are apriori, schelling says its nature thats apriori. And asks **what must nature be such that mind can emerge out of it?** now hes not an emergentist that thinks that nature is subjective from the very beginning, but only becomes self conscious as a result of this long evolutionary process that leads to the human being. Hes quite anthropocentric but well come back to that. Rather than mind being apriori for the conditions of our experience, Schelling says nature is apriori and develops an evolutionary account that nature goes through to arrive at mind, he would say famously that nature is visible spirit, mind or that our consciousness is invisible nature. So he has this sense in which human beings, nature, the universe become conscious of itself - which in our circles we are so used to hearing, but schelling was one of the first to really work idea out. 

So he begins with a picture of nature where you could almost say that hes not pretending he can understand how nature began outside of his own conscious experience, now at a later stage of his development. But I read his method  as basically alchemically distilling down our own self conscious experience to its most basic potencies, and saying that nature begins with this basic form of this subjectivity, which for him actually needs to be polarised. He says everything begins with gravity and light, where light is the expansive force that wants to expand into infinity, and gravity is this contracting force that wants to hide away and shrink into nothing. These forces never exist apart from eachother but are constantly struggling with eachother, so he describes through a series of stages how these two infinite forces try to meet and defeat eachother, and arrive at a series of temporary equilibria that continue to spill over and become more complex. So he describes a movement from light and gravity, through magnetism and electricity, through chemistry to biology and on to human consciousness and self consciousness. Where evolution proceeds, searching for equilibirum that it can never find, and he thinks that by moving up this series of stages theres an approximation to equilibrium reached, in say chemistry that wasnt there in electricity and magnetism, and then in organism there is this kind equalibrium where theres a sort of circular causality, where an organism has to maintain itself far from equilibrium but non the less maintain our form. So theres a kind of temporary stability thats preceeded by this homeostasis, homeorecess is probably a better account to keep things in motion. 

so he has this evolutionary account where this process of complexification is not simply a random accident but a self revelation of god, this is evolutionary panenthism, theres a term in german Gheisliblicheit, which means a spiritual embodyment, which is kind of an incarnational account that schelling is giving here, where the tangible spatiotemporal world is not maya but the divine is seeking to become more perfect and complete, throught the process of incarnation. so i think the picture that schelling is suggesting to us is one where rather than thinking of an actual world of space time as, the top part of the iceberg and the quantumn world below it. He would want us to think more in termms as always a mixture of the two, and while we could get confused and think of everything as the spacetime model, what shelling is saying is not that there is this 3D container of physical bodies, and this realm of possibilities. He talkso of potencies and talks of possibilities but he wants us to inhabit one world, where both of these elements are constantly interpenetrating, and where rather than thinking of the tangible physical world as maya, even if its not the purely illusory form but the playful manifestation, this is actually quite serious for schelling, this is the divine trying to enter into ever deeper relationships with itself. So the physical world the embodied world of physical organisms and self conscious lining organisms like us, is really gods purpose that that unfolds. its not just maya. This geisliblicheit idea that schellings inhereting from some of the swavian piestic mystics that he grew up with, is a significant, maybe it exists in some tension with some of the other aisian traditions that weve heard about today.

So let me give you a quick tour of schellings publications. 

So he began in the 1790s wiht a few early essays that were responding to vigda and very much in line vith vigdas thought, doing trancendental philosophy beginning with the I and its activity and then trying to show how the whole world could unfold just from the activit of the I, so in the late 1790s around 24/25 he wrote a series of books on the philosophy of nature. Beginning with ideas for a philosophy of nature in 1797 and then the first outline for a theory of a philosophy of nature in 1799. THen in 1800 he wrote this text called "on the world soul a hypothesisis of higher physics for the explanation of the universal organism", which got goeths attention and goethe then told the university of yana to hire scelling who at that point an unpaid professor, and he was wildly popular becoming at 25 the most popualar philosopher in germany. Even in america, later, it took a while for word to travel but in the 30s he was all ther rage amongsts the american trancendentalists, they were translating his work and publishing it the dial and so on. 

So he really had this turn towards nature in the late 1790s and early 1800s where hes trying to say that nature is apriori as a dynamically evolving system, and human self consciousness is an elaboration upon a potency of potentiality that was always latent in nature. (schelling pre emerson in the 1830s question).

So then in the early 1800s he has a neoplatonian turn where he realises that he has a figdeean approach where everything spills out of the I, and then he has a natural philosophical approach where the I spills out of the natural world, and is like 'how do i coordinate the two', so hes realising there must be an indifference point or an absolute thats beyond subject and object, and these two approaches that hes elaborating beyond the subjective trancendental approach and the objective natuaral philosophy approach, are just two ways of coordinating our approach to the absolute and neither gets there fully. He tended to privilage the natural philosophy approach but was wanted this to be a coordinate way for getting at something beyond finite rational thought, because the absolute is the unthingable and so the unthinkable. And so he was working this out for a few years from 1806, Hagel finishes the phenemonology of spirit, gets the proof sent off to the printer just an napoleans army is invading vienna and the proofs suprvived, in which Hagel critisises schelling (or is percieved to have) by implying schelling and his followers think of the absolute as a night in which all cows are black. Meaning nothing can be distinguished and its just a soup. Schelling, was upset by this obviously, and in a letter to Hagel says 'can you specify that your not talking about me when you make that critisism' to which hagel responds 'i thought it was obvious that I was talking about some of your lesser lights amongst your followers, not you' - which makes sense because when schelling and hagel were coediting a journal together some years earlier, schelling uses the same metaphor, critically, to dismiss this where he says 'the absolute is NOT a night in which all cows are black' - so hagels borrowing schellings own metaphor so theres a littel confusion there in the recption of the history. Although Hagel wrote back to say of course I wasnt talking about you, their close friendship pretty much fades out at this point. 

Hagel became famous many years later, but from that point forward, shelling realised theres a major problem with this whole approach to the absolute in philosophy trying to develop the system which would alow us to relate everything to the absolute. And Hagel claims at the end of the phenemonology to have arrived at absolute knowledge, schelling was very uncomfortable with this but i think that he needed Hagel to articulate it in such brilliance, because schelling started to say at this point that the absolute, the godhead is not a system its a life, god is alive, god is freedom, **and our own freedom is a reflecion of that divine ground** and the idea that that freedom could be curtailed and neatly wrapped up in a system was horrendus from schellings point of view. And so its not that schelling gave up system, its that he said basically that each one of us needs to develop our own system, which may seem like a contradiction so schelling starting to refer to it as 'my system' and you need your system, so that it would feel coherent, internally consistent to you; because we all have unique once occurent perspective on this mystery. 

And later Charles Sanders Pierce, wrote in a letter to William James, about how much he admired schelling - because its not just that I need my own system, its that tomorrow I may need a newer system the one I had yesterday - so Schelling in Pirece's view, was a very scientific thinker because he was starting again, over and over again from new points of view, trying to develop a system, but never being attached to a particular system. SO Peirce really admired this and his evolutionary cosmology and panenthisiam, is inheriting some of schellings insights and updating the science, as whitehead would also do.
