A quick reflection on Process and Thought lecture 1, the content is provided by Matt Segall whos pretty well known for his expertise on Whitehead lecturing an the CIIS. For a primer on Whitehead you probably wont find a better instructor. This commentary is my interpretation of Matts understanding of Whitehead so it will probably contain many errors on their framing. 

What's interesting is to discover that I may be more familliar with Process Philosophy than initially thought, as listening to Matt I immediately hear strong correspondences with JG Bennetts work, an author who's philosophy I am very familliar with, who seemed to reference Whitehead a great deal. This makes sense given the timeline. 

Onwards with the course - Matt claims that Whitehead did not see the universe as divided, instead he saw it as relational where every actual occasion of experience from sub-atomic particles to stars and galaxies is a unity of physical and mental feelings. 

Metaphysically, the echoes here are already quite familliar as Matt is first talking about an undivided and thus contineous or maybe Monadic universe. This undivided and relational universe sounds like it's composed from a qualitive infinity of occasions, broadly termed potential and actual - from the very small to the very large! 

You might consider this a paradox because the universe is undivided, yet also there is differences between occasions, where the chair is not the table. This is a pretty old discussion and I believe the core distinction between substance philosophy and process philosophy. We can resolve this difference between contineous and discreet by saying that there are types and degrees of relation. 

In Bennetts work this discreet division of occasions or entities is broadly classified into categories called "apokritikal levels of being":

Matt claims that Whitehead puts biology and life at the center of the universe, rather than physics, which is a pretty strong turn of phrase. If you take the twelve levels in the image above and divide it into three sets of four, organised from bottom to top you get three realms: hyponomic, autonomic and hypernomic. These terms basically translate as material, living and cosmic. As you can see for yourself the middle range beginning from Phytovegetation and ending with Humans in the autonomic realm, essentially matches the assertion that life is central in these cosmologies. 

To be transparent about the epistemology, the 12 levels articulated relate to the concrete significance of number, which is further described Bennetts Dramatic Universe; the foundations of natural science. 

Matt goes on to talk about how the biological (autonomic) world is a revelation to what's implicit in the physical (hyponomic) world. Referencing the image above you can see that both authors seem to hold the same views once again, though the diagram perhaps allows us to reason about the relationships between actual occasions and into levels like the hypernomic realms of planets, stars, and galaxies - which would be a revelation to the autonomic world as well! 

This is perhaps where the terminology diverges, because this would be the more than living world, or superanimate existence perhaps this is where God resides in Whiteheads philosophy? Oh unfathomable totality, greather than even a collection of galaxies! 

While the terminology diverges, the views still seem to align and using these categories we can start to reason by analogy between worlds; what if we consider ourselves as atoms or magnetic fields, how do the laws of this level apply to say sociology? And how do our actions influence the heavens? 

Matts use of the term fundemental may seem confuning at first, because this idea of fundementality may seem like substance philosophy (think object oriented), but the contextual qualifier is that ecology becomest the most fundemental science because it's about relationships between organisms. This seems allowable as everything is an occasion and these occasions are 'fundementally' seen as organisms. In order to avoid confusion in terminology, I'm going to lean on the Hodgson qualifier and call this perspective a 'Cosmic Ecology' which refers to a form of second order science. So maybe this fundemental is more an understanding that's based on principals of rational ordering, relational binding and the process of ongoing realisation? 

This leads us into anthropic principals both active and passive, where we get into matters of reflexivity and reciprocity, and perhaps even accontability. This of course takes us into very uncertain territory where we are specualting on matters like god and religion, but what cosmology would be complete without an origination myth and rich narrative structure, as well as its existential grounding or law conformity? 

This opens up some fantastic questions with regards to living cosmologies and moral philosophy, which is where some of the discussion about the realisation of facts and values seems to belong. Is there such a thing as objective morality? A second order perspective would allow this, where facts are the realisation of cosmic values as laws, which in turn enable the realsation of subjective values. Fact as the realisation of value was somewhat touched on in the lecture, though I've taken things a little further to express an alternative aspect of the ternary relationship based on Bennett and Hodgsons work in order to enrich the synthesis. Nothing ground breaking by any means, others said it all first, but an offering in tune with the spirit of this work. 

Hopefully these expressions will be of further value to someone as well!
