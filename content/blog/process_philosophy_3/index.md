Panpsychism

Heraclitus, all things flow and have an ever living fire that animates it from the inside out. The world is ensouled, panspsychism is the philosophical animism.

David Chalmers, the hard problem of consciousness; understanding everything from a functional point of view still begs the question why is there experience?

Michael levin, driven to adopt panpsychism to explain the collective intelligence of cells. In turn organising to humans. Cells must be organiised by cells particippating in goals in morphospace that no one cell can understand or percieve, so cells need to merge to generate emergent levels of agency.

Panpsychism; The view that all thing, in all their aspects consist exclusively of 'souls', that is, of various kinds of subjects or units experiencing with their qualifications, relations and groupings or communities. -Charles Hartshorne

In contrast to idealism, panpsychists generally resist the monistic tendency to reduce finite individuals to an absolute spirit or megamind. What cannot be interpreted as a single sentient subject may be dealt with as a group or crowd of subjects (Leibnizian principal) or as an element in a more comprehensive single subject (Fechnerian principal).

This is the combination problem. Can minds be made of minds, higher minds made of lower minds etc. William James suggests that we let go of the logical and accept that this is how things do organise.

Whitehead calls the reconciliation between experiential continuity and discontinutiy 'concresence'. The growth of experiential units having a positive and negative pole that gathers in perished objects of the past, growing together as a new unit of experience in order to become a new unit of experience as a superject, which perishes and launches itself into the future to be inhereted as an object in the next subjective occurance.

Whitehead sees the world as rhythms, life as rhythm

Matt on precognition... Whitehead and so Griffin are worried that allowing for retrocausality means the future is not open. Perhaps its probablistic he suggests in order to bypassing whitheads concern. Alex: Ingression from eternity to actualisation. Hyparxis. Prehension as the key beyond duality, if you think in terms of polarities rather than dualities. Parasites of the mind; materialism and the mechanical view - the picture that everything that has to happen through physical touch then of course prehension and imagination are ruled out. We must become artists, get high or read a lot of philosophy to bootstrap out of ignorance.

Whitehead suggests that Gallelei and Locke tried to seperate the primary from the secondary characteristics; quantities, vs subjective stuff. But even force that is a mechanistic physical concept is tied to our subjective experience. Prehension as a metaphysical invention lets us understand physical causation to affect, feeling, emotion, memory and perception as the same concept. Feelings of the future are propositional feelings, conceptual and physical prehensions. Learning languages as psychedelic drugs.

Materialism as a teenager that got hold of the car keys, naieve.
