Bridging the gap between Goethe and Whitehead

What does a non-bifurcated science looklike? Whiteheads critique on the bifurcation of nature, the seperation of quantity and experential quality. Theres no justification to make this kind of bifurcation other than as a shorthand to make the measurable aspects more apparent.

The red hue of a sunset vs. the electromagnetic radaition that the physisist would talk of. Goeth was working on this science of sense about a centuary before whitehead. We are the most precice instrument for the observation of nature that one could ask for. Not opposed to using instruments but was worried that if we allow science to be subsumed by instruments, we would loose our sense of proportion and see life and mind as unimportant impositions in a well behaved universe. 

"Human experience is an act of self origination inclusive of the whole of nature limited to the perspective of a focal region within the body."

The universe is composed of actual entities, wrongly identified as tiny quantum events, which is not what whitehead suggests. An actual entity is not a partical, its an abstract category. Attempting to avoid the fallacy of misplaced concreteness he engages in feats of extreame abstraction. Relates to Xenos paradox as mathmatical analysis of motion and emeprical observation seem to be in conflict. 

Whitehead attempts to resolve this paradox through pulses of actualisation, actual occasions like drops of impulses. Atoms as misleading balls, rather than atoms as wholes in the greek sense, not just one whole but a becoming that gives rise to new wholes or actual occasions where the whole universe is felt and unified in each occasion. Each occasion brings forth an new whole with a new perspective, the do not endure but arise perish. The universe grows like an embryo divides. 

A cell theory of actuality, is a homage to how nature organises. Therese also a society of occasions where many actual occasions are in a temporal flow where the past is carried forward into the future. 

Concresence. The physical pole inherets the feelings or prehensions of the past and conceptually ingresses into the mental pole. Only some of these possibilities are relevant and the majority are negatively prehended. Each being lured towards a subjective aim to become the superject, which dies to itself and becomes the objective data of the future. This evolves more complex societies of occasion where more possilities can be explored rather than simple repition of the past. 

Witeheads god as remembering the past internally along with the concrest actual occasions eternally. Gods nature as holding together all the actual occasions and relationships of all the patterns that have ever been actualised. Necessary so that that laws of nature perservere. 

Also God functions as the lures of feeling. Primordial vs consequent natures of god. Primordial nature as ordering and limitation of potentials. God as actual entity but not an actual occasion as god is never finalised.
