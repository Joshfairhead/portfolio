A lot can be said about the VSM, but it would seem that the theoretical overhead often gets in the way of practice, which can really be quite simple.

Below is an interpretation of Staffords model through the pentadic lens of JG Bennett, which can act as a map for those in leadership wishing to grasp the signigicance of their organisanion, or a game can be facilitated to help self organising groups better align their activities and interests. 

The core concept here is to simply map activities to edges.
