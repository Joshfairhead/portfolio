### **Verse**
Anxious of this apathy,<br />
Concepts crashing constantly,<br />
Guess work near ensnaring me,<br />
Forest through the trees, trees,<br />
- (Voice one: Rise on the 2 count, Voice 2: Rise on the 3 count) G C CpA# D#

Cautious but so cavalier,<br />
Core is feeling all but clear,<br />
Chased from freeing all my fears,<br />
Inert for lack of sleep.<br />

### **Bridge Chorus**
Mountains on my heart, on my, on my head; the weight.<br />
Orbiting my thoughts inner, outer space; gravity.<br />

### **Main Chorus**
Reeling though mind-fields asleep,<br />
Fleeting through this lucid dream, watch the feet.<br />
Reeling though mind-fields asleep,<br />
Impose upon this lucid dream, conscious stream.<br />

### **Verse**
Fractured overbearing thoughts,<br />
Old charged streaming juggernaughts,<br />
Sentiment is scattershot,<br />
Floating on the breeze.<br />

Neglect ones broke formalities,<br />
My constructs; fabric vanities,<br />
Select some new modalities,<br />
Theres wolves amongst the sheep.<br />

### **Bridge Chorus**
Mountains on my heart, on my, on my head; the weight.<br />
Orbiting my thoughts inner, outer space; gravity.<br />

### **Main Chorus**
Reeling though mind-fields asleep,<br />
Fleeting through this lucid dream, watch the feet.<br />
Reeling though mind-fields asleep,<br />
Impose upon this lucid dream, conscious stream.<br />

### **Build - middle 8**
Graa-haaav-ity

### **Main Chorus**
Reeling though mind-fields asleep,<br />
Fleeting through this lucid dream, watch the feet.<br />
Reeling though mind-fields asleep,<br />
Impose upon this lucid dream, conscious stream.<br />
