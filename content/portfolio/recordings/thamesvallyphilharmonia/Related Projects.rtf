It would be great to be able to put this in my select work section but\'a0unfortunately\'a0the orchestra were often out of tune and off time. These errors made the piece very disheartening to mix; as it was a project myself and friends undertook purely for fun and experience I will not be dedicating much time to it as the result will always be an unsatisfying listen.\'a0Despite this it was something that I'd\'a0defiantly\'a0like to repeat with more time, adequate recording setup and\'a0more professional orchestra. The following is an explanation of our undertaking:\
\
A friend involved in an orchestral piece (playing the guitar\'a0amongst\'a0a quartet) was told by the composer that she intended to record the piece with a pair of overheads. Instead he suggested that myself, Darren and Carlos might record it and put us in contact; there was a shoestring budget 40 something musicians and whatever resources we could get our hands on. Consequentially the recording system ended up as a bit of a mutant as none of our interfaces had near enough I/O along with a lack of software support for multiple interfaces; to get around this we synced two computers running Logic with Midi Time Code. From our two <a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct03/articles/digi002rack.htm">Digi 002's</a>, my <a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/dec06/articles/saffire.htm">Focusrite Saffire</a> and three other external pre-amps loaned from our university/rented,\'a0we had a\'a0total\'a032 inputs. Mic cables, a multicore and a heap of microphones were borrowed from college, most mic stands were either bought online or rented from FX rentals (along with two <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/images/mic_extras/neumann/KM84-KM184-frequency.png">Neumann KM84s</a>).\
\
Initially we were told that we could set up in the hall\'a0throughout\'a0the day before the musicians arrived; these circumstances changed last\'a0minute and we had to set up, complete the recording and tear down between 6 and 10pm.\'a0As some players had also pulled out at a day or two before recording we were asked if the strings could be double tracked, we agreed but this now required a lot of headphones and amps. Several of the amplifiers were borrowed from our university/rented and about 30 pairs of headphones were arranged from the conductors university to be set up around the hall; despite the 30 working pairs headphones they were not used due to the time pressure of continuing on to another of music.\
\
The main ambient set up was a Mid/Side diverging into what could be called a modified Decca because of the two spaced omni's we used at the side. This worked quite well in terms of sound quality and was built upon with spot mics for the different sections although our extra 'side section spot' mics were pretty useless from the spill.\
\
The Jazz four piece were pretty good but were only given one chance at a proper take after which they were begging for a second chance and my sympathy goes to them since they were not permitted another run through (to be fair though the conductor needed to get through another two pieces of music and made do with the take even though the piece was her own composition).\
\
Considering we had four hours to set up, practice and record four pieces of music and then tear down in the same time frame I think we did pretty well for the circumstances; as a\'a0colleague\'a0pointed out we wouldn't have tried record the three piece in that amount of time let alone 40\'a0something\'a0musicians, but it was an experience to say the least.\

<h2><strong>Elephants Dream - Post Production</strong>\
<img class="size-medium wp-image-298 alignright" title="Hyperspeed Matress Hut" src="http://joshportfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/Hyperspeed-Matress-Hut-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><iframe height="225" width="400" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/20465972" frameborder="0"></iframe></h2>\
<p style="text-align: left;">This was for a module I studied on the Music Technology (specialist) BA; we were given the assignment of doing the post production (ADR, sound design and mix) for a clip of choice. We were also allowed to work in pairs provided we double the playing length of the assignment (5 min) to ten minutes; which is exactly what myself and my housemate <a title="Darren Jennings" href="http://darrenportfolio.com/">Darren Jennings</a> did; choosing the 10 min open source movie '<a title="Elephants Dream" href="http://www.vimeo.com/1132937" target="_blank">Elephants Dream</a>' by the <a title="Blender foundation" href="http://www.blender.org/blenderorg/blender-foundation/" target="_blank">Blender foundation</a>.</p>\
The original contained lip sync issues that really reflected badly on the\'a0animation\'a0considering that things like lip smacks and breaths were animated but not heard. To redub the voices we built a huge dead space from\'a0mattresses\'a0and set up a second monitor, a C414 as a close mic and Shunyun Cy90s as a stereo distance pair a bit further back; the idea being to have our signals as dry as possible and applying ambience later to account for multiple onscreen spaces. Because the original contained lip sync issues we\'a0occasionally\'a0had to modify lines in order to fit words to the characters better; all of which were synced by replaying the parts over and over until the delivery was right (or unfortunately in some cases as close as possible).\
\
After this we had to create footsteps, cloth noises, breaths and lip smacks. Convincing footsteps sounds are\'a0surprisingly\'a0hard to get right and finding the right surfaces are pretty\'a0unintuitive; we often found that things like carpet sounded like gravel on recording and that to actually sound like their on carpet you need pillows or other materials of varying texture/density. The most fun part here was probably syncing Proogs breaths as he dances on metal plates that come up to meet his feet from the abyss.\
\
Creating the sound design was probably the most enjoyable aspect of the project; being based in a weird living machine there was plenty of room for creativity. The hardest bits were the huge metal arms throwing the pod and then it\'a0subsequently\'a0breaking to pieces; the sound files were gathered by taking a Zoom H2 down to some metal skips after 3am when the traffic had quieted and banging them with a golf club wrapped in masking tape (for a soft attack) and is probably the most memorable part of the project for me. We also got a good sample from banging a manhole cover quickly with a shoe which gave a nice heavy resonance.\'a0At the end when the Colossus\'a0appears we were knocking over bricks onto an old piece of cabinet, recording the sound with a D112 when we discovered that we could get a really low end shake by dragging bricks along a metal bar which was attached to the cabinet, placing the mic stand on top to resonate in sympathy.\
\
Overall I think it turned out pretty well; there are parts that could use more sound design and the mix could be better but considering the ADR, movements, spots, sound design and mix\'a0were done in under a month (along with write ups) I think its alright. I'd like to have filled in the tunnel with some ambient wind, added more high end layers to the\'a0Colossus (for small speakers) and a few more booms and crashes when its fist(?) hits the ground. Our lecturer didn't see too many shortcomings, marking the project at 73% (a 1:1)\

<h2><strong>Les Paul Replica</strong></h2>\

<strong> </strong> Back in school I decided I wanted to build a Les Paul for my Leaving Cert practical project in construction studies, the\'a0picture shown being the final result. I started by planing two planks of mahogany for the body which were the glued together with a\'a0biscuit\'a0joint. Next I glued the flamed maple top together and stuck it to the mahogany and cut the wood to shape from an internet template.\
\
I then attached a router blade onto a standing drill and routed trenches in a stepped formation of about 2-3mm from the top down and sanded them smooth to get a rough carved shape to the top. To create a nicer contour though I used a radiused cabinet scraper to really enhance the concave effect along the edges and other appropriate places.\
\
The neck was made from mahogany with a rosewood finger board; ebony doesn't resonate as well and is over harvested leading to the depletion of the species which is why I didn't go down that route. The neck design was also bolt on rather than through the body making repairs easier if I ever damage it.\
\
Basically to create this I took a plank of mahogany cut to the right width and routed a trench for the truss rod (used to keep the neck straight) and glued the finger board on top. I radiused the neck correctly by taking measurements from my Stratocaster and then used a bullnose plain to carve its relief. The fingerboard was radiused by drawing a 16" circle and cutting out an inverse segment the width of said fingerboard; once the fingerboard fitted snugly into this cutting the radius was right...\
\
So back to the body; I needed to route the pocket for the neck and so constructed a jig to do such. The bridge posts also had to be drilled with the bass post needing an 1/8" adjustment back to allow for proper intonation because of the added tension from lower/thicker strings. A cavity in the back was also created to fit the electronics inside along with recesses for the pickups. The body was then stained with a heavily concentrated dark blue (black stain being rare) and sanded down with the process being repeated several times; this is because the heavier grain absorbs more of the stain while the lighter layer comes off quite easily which eventually leads to the black and grey stripes. After sealing it was simply a matter of wiring the pickups and attaching the hardware.}
