It would be great to be able to put this in my select work section but unfortunately the orchestra were hobbyists that were often out of tune and off time making it quite unlistenable and disheartening to mix. Despite this it was a project that I would defiantly like to repeat with some more time, an adequate recording setup and a more professional orchestra. The following is an explanation of the project:

An old school friend that was involved in an orchestral piece (playing the guitar in the quartet) was told by the composer that she intended to record the piece with just a stereo pair. Instead he suggested that myself, Darren and Carlos might record it and put us in contact with each other; there was a shoestring budget, 46 musicians and whatever resources we could get our hands on. Consequentially the recording system ended up as a bit of a mutant as none of our interfaces had anywhere near enough inputs and out DAWs lacked support for multiple interfaces, so to get around this we synced two computers running Logic with Midi Time Code and compiled the sessions later. From our two <a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct03/articles/digi002rack.htm">Digi 002's</a>, my <a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/dec06/articles/saffire.htm">Focusrite Saffire</a> and three other external pre-amps on loan from our university/rented, we had a total of 32 inputs. Mic cables, a multicore and a heap of microphones were borrowed from college while most mic stands were either bought online or rented from FX rentals (along with two <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/images/mic_extras/neumann/KM84-KM184-frequency.png">Neumann KM84s</a>).

Initially we were told that we could set up in the hall throughout the day before the musicians arrived but these circumstances changed last minute and so we had to set up, complete the recording and tear everything down between 6pm to 10pm. As some players had also pulled out at a day or two before recording we were asked if the strings could be double tracked, we agreed but this now required a lot of headphones and amps. Several of the amplifiers were borrowed from our university/rented and about 30 pairs of cans were arranged from the conductors university to be set up around the hall; despite this working fine the fold-back was not used due to the time pressure of continuing on to another of music.

The main ambient set up was a Mid/Side pair diverging into what could be called a modified Decca tree because of the two spaced omni's we used at the side. This worked quite well in terms of sound quality and was built upon with spot mics for the different sections although our extra 'side section spot' mics were pretty useless from the undefined spill.

The quartet were pretty good but were only given one chance at a proper take after which they were pretty much begging for a second chance, my sympathy goes to them since they were not permitted another run through; though to be fair the conductor needed to get through another two pieces of music and made do with the bad take even though the piece was her own composition.

Considering we had four hours to set up, practice and record four pieces of music and then tear down in the same time frame I think we did pretty well for the circumstances; as a colleague pointed out we wouldn't have tried record the quartet in that amount of time let alone 46 musicians, but it was an experience to say the least...
