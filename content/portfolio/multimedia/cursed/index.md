This was an animation created by Brian O’Shea who studied animation in BCFE Dublin at the same time that I was enrolled on the Music Technology course there. After seeing Brians animatic and I my lecturer to let me work with him and was told to create the musical composition while another student was assigned the diegetic (on screen) sound; time permitting I might re-do this myself for a bit of practice/fun...

The plot behind the animation is that the girl in the forest is cursed; anything she touches dies. One day a boy appears and wants to play but fearing she might harm him she runs away, this is mistaken for play and the boy gives chase. After a bridge collapses and the boy is left hanging the girl is left with the ultimatum of pulling the him up – killing him with her touch – or letting him fall to his death... 

For the music Brian requested that I create something along the lines of ‘You Were There’ which appears on the ICO soundtrack and seemed like a rather appropriate choice considering his conceptual work. I’m quite happy to say that he was good at letting me know when scenes would be longer or shorter than the working version I was given, while a standard frame rate was also adhered to which made life quite easy in comparison to some other student work I was helping with at the time...

The music was mostly created using the virtual instruments Absynth, Mini grand and Structure Free; over which I then dubbed some real mandolin (played quite badly by myself). The drums required little programing as they were supposed to be somewhat symbolical of life and were to be reminiscent of a heart beat; the only real variation on the basic pattern was the odd crash cymbal and an delay line that slows down in the fade to black as the boy falls (implying the end for him).

All in all it was a fun project which unfortunately has some nagging flaws in it. I don't really feel my rendition came anywhere near close enough to the ICO track and sounds quite like a cheap knock off... but then I suppose I’m not studying composition for a reason.
