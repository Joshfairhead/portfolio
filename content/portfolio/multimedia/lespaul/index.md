<strong> </strong> Back when I was studying my Leaving Certificate (ending school) I decided to build a Les Paul replica for the construction studies practical project. I started this by planing two planks of Mahogany for the body to match perfectly and then clamped them together with a biscuit joint. After this I glued a flamed maple top together, stuck it to the Mahogany planks and cut the wood to shape from an internet template.

I then attached a router blade onto a standing drill to route some trenches in a stepped formation (of about 2-3mm from the top down) and sanded them smooth to get a rough carved shape to the top. To get a nicer contour I then used a radiused cabinet scraper in order to enhance the typical concave effect in the appropriate places.

The neck was made from Mahogany with a Rosewood finger board; Ebony doesn't resonate as well and is apparently over harvested, slowly leading to a depletion of the species and so on the advice of Chris Larkin – an Irish luthier that I was in contact with – Rosewood was used instead. The neck design was also bolt on rather than through the body which will make repairs or replacement a lot easier if the guitars ever damaged.

Basically to create the neck I took a plank of mahogany cut to the right width and routed a trench for the truss rod (used to keep the neck straight), glueing the finger board on top. I radiused the neck to a familiar feel by taking measurements from my Stratocaster and then using a bullnose plain to carve its relief. The fingerboard was radiused by drawing a 16" circle and cutting out an inverse segment the same width; once the fingerboard fitted snugly into this I knew the radius was right...

So back to the body: I needed to route a pocket for the neck and so had to construct a floating jig because the bodies uneven surface was again unsuitable for sitting the router on as well as needing the neck to be slightly angled. The bridge posts also had to be drilled with the bass post needing an 1/8" adjustment back to allow for proper intonation due to the added tension from the lower/thicker strings. A cavity in the back was also created to fit the electronics inside along with recesses for the pickups. 

The maple top was then stained with a heavily concentrated dark blue (black stain being rare) and then sanded down repeating the process several times; as the heavier grain absorbs more of the stain and because the lighter layer comes off quite easily the process eventually leads to the black and grey stripes seen in the picture. Once this was completed and after sealing the top with Danish Oil it was simply a matter of wiring the pickups and attaching the hardware before the body was complete; however the frets needed to be cut/filed and dressed along with the nut before the two sections could be joined together to complete the guitar.
