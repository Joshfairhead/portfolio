Hermitage was an early prototype of a Holochain interface where users could interface with the network while retaining control of their data and managing capabilities. This addressed the question of "what does the everything interface actually look like" - a question becoming ever more relevant in the age of AI. The project won first place in the Odyssey Momentum SSI track, leading to work and consultation with Akasha Hub and the Dutch Blockchain Coalition.
