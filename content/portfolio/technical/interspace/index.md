Interspace.chat was developed by the hackalong community during the pandemic as and interface for open space gatherings. Participants in an event could wander freely between Jit.si rooms by clicking different elements in a front end portal. This got taken up by a number of projects in the ethereum space; the [Solidity Summit](https://www.soliditylang.org/blog/2020/04/17/Solidity-Summit-2020-Goes-Interspace/), [ethTurin](https://staging.ethturin.interspace.chat), [MetaFest](https://interspace.metagame.wtf/),[NonCon](https://noncon.interspace.chat).
