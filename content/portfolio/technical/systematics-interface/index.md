### Why

The field of arteficial intelligence is complex and solving any singular aspect is unlikely to be of much much value due to the non-linear and highly systemic nature of these systems. If we want safe performant systems then we need to work cross functionally across domains like interpretability, representation, and construction. 

### How
The inter-related nature of complex problems, requires a relational approach, which in this case would is a functional linguistic ontology. Without going too deep into his work, Bennett offers a set of ontological lenses through a set of complete graphs which link the stable or invarient elements of a vocabulary together as a sort of 'natural language metaphysics' that can be transformed according to the mathmatical principals of appliced category theory. In other words we are talking about systems of transformation (morphisms and functors) that are applicable to both qualative and quantative domains, represented visually as complete graphs. 

### What

In concrete terms, we are using number to create graphs that recursively contain other numeric systems. We start with a series of numbers - which have a particular quality - and turn them into graphs. The graphs encapsulate systems of systems where each number within a graph represents a complete graph, and a complete graph is made of nodes which in turn represents numbers, each of which representing a given sysems. 

For example the number four represents a tetradic K4 graph, which in turn contains nodes representing systems 1-4, so clicking the third node would open up a K3 triadic interface with a new set of terms.

### Horizon 1

The backend is intended to be extensible through category theory and bootstraps from three basic categories; topology, geometry, vocaublary delivered over an API. These categories are complete in so far as they are enough to create an interface for autopoietic improvement; building out the grammars of each domain. In other words we can use the API to create an index, plot them as nodes on a graph (semantic positioning) and then represent the core vocabulary in line with these semantics. 

### Horizon 2

This creates a functional foundation for further bootstrapping a more complete epistemology with hermenutic consistency, thats based on the concrete significance of number. With this backbone in place we can then begin to add new categroical schemas to the system, be those maps of mathmatical spaces or Bennetts own work categorising science, philosophy, society and cosmology - which is obviously low hanging fruit:

### Horizon 3 

With these elements in place we can start to work on adding the category theoretic elements to the system, namely the various transformation types between 'objects' like the indexes, coordinates or terms and the 'categories' such as topology, geometry and vocabulary - or Bennets own, indicated in the diagrams above. These are not cannonical, and will be added to a library as part of horizon two. We can of course add other community vocabularies, as well as codify alternative grammars as the build progresses. 

The ability to add vocabulary and grammars in such a codified form opens up many possible use cases in domains like interpretability, representation, steerability, and so on - for example, allowing us to probe latent space with different vocabularies in order to get a sense of an LLMs circuits, or we can link together knowledge graphs for the purposes of reasoning and explainability. There are quite a lot of possible applications at this point. 

With regards to the category theoretic elements, our bootstrapping structures in place we can start looking at processes such as the morphisms between elements internal to a categroy, the functors between categories, or the homotopy types within and across categroies that articulate a sort of state model or hilbert space (note that each system is itself a kind of homotopy type). 

For example we examine the cross category equivelence mappings between index 1 and coordinate 1 and term 1, which I believe is called the functorial semantics. Or we could look at morphism types between nodes in a given category such as isomorphisms, endomorphisms, homomorphisms and so on. We can look at linear transformations such as the fibrations illustrated below where sub-animate existence encapsulates the universal field/radiation, elemental complexes, molocular structures, soil and ocean and so on for the animate and super animate levels of existence. Or we can work out the non-linear transforms between systems such as from a monad of humanity > dyad of man/woman > the triad of father/mother/child. **(Note to self this is possibly a sort of qualative fourrier transform).**

Building this prototype so that it is self consistent and ultimately correct by construction has already presented many challenges and bootstrapping issues, but horizon one is starting to take shape, navigating a dilemma between interface development and the backend API seems to be ensuring that it shakes out correctly. 

This is of course still a far from complete project as the prototype uses implicit links to connect these categories rather than explicitly binding them through a category theoretic engine of some sort. In order to build such an engine correctly however it certainly helps to try and visualise the movements, as the graphs provide a validation function that enables the formalisation of category theoretic rules. In other words, they act as a reference framework where one can ask questions about the different possibilities for transformation.
