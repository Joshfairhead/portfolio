## About me

When teams face complex challenges—unclear priorities, competing perspectives, or decisions that feel stuck—I create structured spaces where the real picture can emerge. Through visual facilitation, we map what's actually happening, surface what matters most, and find pathways forward that everyone can see and support.

My approach draws from systems thinking and proven methodologies that help teams navigate complexity with confidence. The visual element isn't just about pretty diagrams—it's about creating shared understanding of the whole.

## Personal guidance & coaching
Beyond organizational work, I offer individual sessions for leaders and change-makers working through:
