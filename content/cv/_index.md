## Experience

##### **Independent Consulting | 2023 – Present**

Consulting on various technology projects with a focus on semantics, knowledge graphs, and neurosymbolic AI while testing intelligence hypotheses through basic implementations. Pro bono facilitation of H3uni study groups on J.G. Bennett's General Systematics.

##### **Ledger Governance Coordinator | Regen Foundation | 2021 – 2022**

Coordinated proposal processes for delegated proof-of-stake community, enabling collaboration between staking DAO delegators, validators, and developers. Developed visual onboarding guides to clarify the roles of markets, science, and technology in relation to people, place, and planet.

##### **Independent Consulting | Sep 2020 - Sep 2021** 

Awarded "Best Multidisciplinary Approach" from Odyssey Momentum's Self Sovereign Identity track sponsored by the Dutch Blockchain Coalition, which led to consulting and further application development. This was one of the worlds lagest and most prestigeous hackathons. 

##### **Stewardship, Design and Innovation | LiminalVillage.com | 2019 - 2020**

Coordinating a community of practice engaging in permaculture, ecological restoration, systems thinking, event organization, and design work for technical projects like [holons.io](https://www.holons.io/).

##### **Ecosystems Development | Commons Stack | 2018 - 2019**

Catalyzing the launch of the [Commons Stack](https://www.commonsstack.org/) while contributing to [Giveth](giveth.io) through narrative development based on Elinor Ostrom's work *Governing the Commons* which involved hackathon organization, community management and cross-team coordination (3/5 teams won prizes).

##### **Product | Pillar Project | 2017 - 2018**

Product management, research, design and development in relation to a cryptocurrency wallet from a first principles perspective. Contributed to scaling organization to approximately 50 people in first year.
