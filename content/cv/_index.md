My role was transdisciplinary nature but from a birds eye view I worked across the domains of product, design, marketing, communications, R&D, events and ecosystem development. More specifically this involved the subjects of distributed identity & key management, distributed storage, encrypted messaging, block explorers, exchanges, KYC, securities, incentive models, game theory, mechanism design, directed acyclic graphs, validating DHT’s, CRDT’s and applying crypto economic primitives.
