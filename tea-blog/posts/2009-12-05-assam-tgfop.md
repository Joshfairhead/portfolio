# Assam T.G.F.O.P.

Josh describes this tea as decent for the price but not exceptional. The brew offers "enough body in it to give a bit of a kick but without over powering you." He notes the flavor leans woody and rates the bitterness slightly above average, though not unpleasantly so. He concludes it works well "for everyday drinking when you want a bit of a hit."
