# Mohokutie Second Flush Assam

This is a "Bloody good assam which has the delicacy of a Darjeeling but with more body and a strength." The reviewer notes that most strength comes from upper midtones, though ideally it would be positioned lower for a more balanced flavor profile. This results in "a subtle bite to it that is only just too sharp."
