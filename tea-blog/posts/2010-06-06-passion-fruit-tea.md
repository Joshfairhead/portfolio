# Passion Fruit Tea (Chinese black tea/Passion fruit)

Josh describes this as "a real summer tea" with passion fruit flavors that intensify as the beverage cools, becoming progressively sweeter. He notes the Chinese black tea base could be improved in quality but blends well with other teas like Orange Pettiagalla Ceylon and The Blue Lady.

The reviewer suggests "in the right quantities it works pretty well" when combined with complementary teas.
