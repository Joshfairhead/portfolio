# Arabian Tea

"This is a mix of unspecified black tea with things like cinamon ant other spices in it. On first tasting its texture is quite thin like a Darjeelings or herbals would but with a bit more strength similar to Earl Grey and a flavour obviously leaning in the Chai direction. Despite only being a person for normal black teas this Earl Greyish Chai isn't too bad. If your into your milky Chai then you could probably mix it with milk in a similar fashon but for me its just a variant on black tea."

The post presents Josh's assessment of an unidentified black tea blend infused with cinnamon and assorted spices. The reviewer notes its resemblance to Earl Grey with chai characteristics, finding it moderately appealing despite preferring conventional black teas.
