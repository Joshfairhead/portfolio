# Ceylon O.P.

The reviewer notes this tea lacks depth, stating "There is an intial taste which is rather solid but has no proper substance to it at the same time." The aftertaste disappears rapidly. Despite being acceptable for the price point, the author expresses a preference for alternative daily options, noting that Ceylon teas are typically their least favored variety overall.
