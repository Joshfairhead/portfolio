# Whittards 125th Anniversary Blend

The blogger speculates the blend combines Ceylon and Darjeeling varieties, noting it delivers "a full bodied taste while also being relatively light." Key characteristics include resistance to bitterness even when over-brewed or allowed to cool, plus "a slightly woody character with floral over tones" producing balanced mid-range flavor notes.

The shop assistant could not identify the specific blend composition, prompting the reviewer's educated guess based on tasting notes rather than confirmed ingredients.
