# Lingia FTGFOP1

Josh evaluated this Darjeeling first flush tea from Lingia Estate, finding it to be decent but overpriced. He noted the tea had adequate strength but lacked notable flavor complexity. The reviewer suggested that brewing adjustments couldn't fully compensate for what he perceived as a thin taste profile.

"I don't believe it warrants the price (essentially £12.50 for 100g)" - suggesting comparable alternatives offered better value.
