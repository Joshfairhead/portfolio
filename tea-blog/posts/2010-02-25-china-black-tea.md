# China Black Tea

Josh reviews a China Black Tea with three accompanying photographs showing the tea's appearance. The post describes the tea as having "very earthy" characteristics and a texture comparable to Darjeeling. He notes it possesses "very thin texture with the oils giving most of the flavor."

The reviewer indicates he would not consume this variety in the morning or regularly. He characterizes the flavor profile as "rubbery rather than floral Darjeeling."

He acquired the tea at no cost - "Glad I got it for free."
