# Blue Lady (Chinese black tea/citrus flavours)

"Lovely flavourful tea thats delicious. The Chinese black tea isn't the greatest but when mixed with the Orange Pettiagalia (just like the passion fruit tea) it gets very nice. Good evening drink but tasty at any time and considering the price its nearly cheap enough to drink on a regular basis."

This review describes a Chinese black tea blend enhanced with orange and citrus elements. The reviewer notes the base tea alone is unremarkable but appreciates how the additional flavors elevate the overall experience, making it suitable for evening consumption at a reasonable price point.
