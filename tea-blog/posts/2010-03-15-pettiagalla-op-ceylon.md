# Pettiagalla O.P. Ceylon

Josh describes this as "some bloody good tea," highlighting its fruity character. He notes the "O.P." designation references Dutch royalty rather than flavor, though he detects subtle orange undertones in the taste profile.

The tea exhibits similarities to typical Darjeeling with its texture but carries noticeably more body. Josh characterizes it as a medium-weight tea and declares it his new favorite at the time of writing.

**Notable Quote:** His flatmate Darren Jennings offered: "If god had dandruff it would be these tea leaves," a humorous reference to the tea leaves' appearance.
