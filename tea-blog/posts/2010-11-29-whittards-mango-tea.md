# Whittard's Mango Tea

The reviewer describes this tea as having a "Fresh and light with a slight fruity flavour." They note that while flavored tea packets typically contain poor quality leaves masked by artificial flavoring, this product differs. The actual tea base appears to be Ceylon quality, and the mango taste registers more as general fruitiness rather than a distinct mango flavor.
