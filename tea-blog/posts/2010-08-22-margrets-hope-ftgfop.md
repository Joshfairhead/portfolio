# Margrets Hope FTGFOP

"So a kinda mellow Darjeeling that tastes pretty much as expected; nothing more, nothing less... Medium strength thats nice and easy for night time drinking but equally suited to daytime drinking. If your looking for a morning waker upper then maybe not the best tea for the job. Other than that its pretty good for everyday drinking considering the price."
