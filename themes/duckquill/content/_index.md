## About me

The perplexing question of identity is perhaps one of the greatest perennial questions we could ask ourselves thanks to an ever changing ephemeral flux that remains mysterious and illusive, ebbing and flowing between essence and existence as if the ocean's edge lapping the shore. 

If you've ever tried explicitly marking this out by drawing lines in the sand, you'll have no doubt encountered difficulty articulating your own eternal nature. No matter, though to move intentionally while alchemically realising ones true and authentic nature with skill and fluidity is perhaps a birthright we have lost and need rediscover. 

This is the research I facilitate.
